Rsbuild is an Rspack-based build tool for the web.

The main goal of Rsbuild is to provide out-of-the-box building capabilities for Rspack users, allowing us to start a Rspack project with zero configuration.

Rsbuild was formerly known as Modern.js Builder, and has now been rebranded. It has been decoupled from Modern.js to provide greater flexibility to meet the needs of community users.

> This project is new and under active development. It will be available in November 2023.

## Features

- 🚀 **Rspack Based**: Using Rspack to bring you the ultimate development experience.
- 🍭 **Easy to Configure**: Start with zero configuration and everything is configurable.
- 🦄 **Batteries Included**: Out-of-the-box integration with the most practical building features in the ecosystem.

- 🎨 **Highly Pluggable**: Comes with a lightweight plugin system and a set of high quality plugins.
