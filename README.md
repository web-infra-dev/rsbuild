Rsbuild is an Rspack-based build tool for the web.

## Why Rsbuild?

The main goal of Rsbuild is to provide out-of-the-box build capabilities for Rspack users, allowing developers to start a web project with zero configuration.

Rsbuild integrates high-performance Rust-based tools from the community, including [Rspack](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspack) and [SWC](https://swc.rs/), to provide first-class build speed and development experience.

Rsbuild also provides universal build capabilities for higher level solutions, such as Rspress and Modern.js. In fact, Rsbuild is a rebrand of the Modern.js Builder. It has been decoupled from Modern.js to provide greater flexibility and to meet the diverse needs of community users.

## Position

The following diagram illustrates the relationship between Rsbuild and other tools in the ecosystem:
