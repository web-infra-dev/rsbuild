Rsbuild is an Rspack-based build tool for the web. The main goal of Rsbuild is to provide out-of-the-box building capabilities for Rspack users, allowing developers to start a web project with zero configuration.

Rsbuild is rebranded from Modern.js Builder. It has been decoupled from Modern.js to provide greater flexibility and to meet the needs of the community users.

## Features

- 🚀 **Rspack Based**: Using Rspack to bring you the ultimate development experience.
- 🦄 **Batteries Included**: Out-of-the-box integration with the most practical building features in the ecosystem.
- 🎯 **Framework Agnostic**: Supports React, Vue, Svelte, and more frameworks.
- 🛠️ **Deep Optimization**: Automatically optimize static assets to maximizing production performance.
- 🎨 **Highly Pluggable**: Comes with a lightweight plugin system and a set of high quality plugins.
- 🍭 **Easy to Configure**: Start with zero configuration and everything is configurable.

## Getting Started

This project is new and under active development. It will be available in November 2023.
