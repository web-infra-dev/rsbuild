      Improve the English docs in `website/docs/en`. Many paragraphs were
      translated from Chinese and may sound unnatural.


      Rewrite sentences that don't read like authentic, professional English —
      **without changing their meaning** — so they match the tone of
      high-quality open-source docs.


      - **IMPORTANT:** Only change a sentence if it clearly improves clarity or
      correctness.

      - **IMPORTANT:** Don't alter the original meaning.

      - If you edit files in `docs/en`, check the same files in `docs/zh` to see
      if similar updates are needed.

      - Use clear, simple language for non-native English readers.

      - Keep reasonable technical abbreviations (e.g., `dev server`).

      - Use sentence case for Markdown headings.

      - Don't change more than 10 files in one PR.

      - Start PR titles with `docs:`.
