# server.publicDir

- **Type:**

```ts
type PublicDir =
  | false
  | {
      /**
       * The name of the public directory, can be set as a relative path or an absolute path.
       * @default 'public'
       */
      name?: string;
      /**
       * Whether to copy files from the publicDir to the distDir on production build
       * @default true
       */
      copyOnBuild?: boolean;
    };
```

- **Default:**

```js
const defaultValue = {
  name: 'public',
  copyOnBuild: true,
};
```

By default, Rsbuild will use the `public` directory as the directory for serving public assets, files in this directory will be served at `/`.

Note that:

- You should always reference public assets using root absolute path. For example, `public/icon.png` should be referenced in source code as `/icon.png`.
- During the production build, the files in public directory will be copied to the output directory (default is `dist`). Please be careful to avoid name conflicts with the output files. When files in the `public` directory have the same name as outputs, the outputs have higher priority and will overwrite the files with the same name in the `public` directory. This feature can be disabled by setting `copyOnBuild` to false.

### Boolean Type

The ability to serve public assets can be disabled by setting `publicDir` to `false`:

```ts
export default {
  server: {
    publicDir: false,
  },
};
```

### Object Type

When the value of `publicDir` is of object type, Rsbuild will merge the current configuration with the default configuration.

For example, to set the public folder name as `static` and disable `copyOnBuild`:

```ts
export default {
  server: {
    publicDir: {
      name: 'static',
      copyOnBuild: false,
    },
  },
};
```

Note that setting the value of `copyOnBuild` to false means that when you run `rsbuild preview` for a production preview, you will not be able to access the corresponding static resources.

### Path Types

The value of `name` can be set to a relative path or an absolute path. Relative path will be resolved relative to the project root directory.

- Relative path example:

```ts
export default {
  server: {
    publicDir: {
      name: '../some-public',
    },
  },
};
```

- Absolute path example:

```ts
import path from 'node:path';

export default {
  server: {
    publicDir: {
      name: path.join(__dirname, '../some-public'),
    },
  },
};
```
