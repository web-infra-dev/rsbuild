# output.assetPrefix

- **Type:** `string | 'auto'`
- **Default:** `'/'`

When using CDN in the production build, you can use this option to set the URL prefix of static assets.

`assetPrefix` will affect the URLs of most of the static assets, including JavaScript files, CSS files, images, videos, etc. If an incorrect value is specified, you'll receive 404 errors while loading these resources.

This config is only used in the production build. During development, please use the [dev.assetPrefix](/config/dev/asset-prefix) to set the URL prefix.

## Example

After setting, the URLs of JavaScript, CSS and other static files will be prefixed with `output.assetPrefix`:

```js
export default {
  output: {
    assetPrefix: 'https://cdn.example.com/assets/',
  },
};
```

After building, you can see that the JS files are loaded from:

```html
<script
  defer
  src="https://cdn.example.com/assets/static/js/main.ebc4ff4f.js"
></script>
```

## Compare with `publicPath`

The functionality of `output.assetPrefix` is basically the same as the [output.publicPath](https://rspack.dev/zh/config/output#outputpublicpath) config in Rspack.

The differences from the native configuration are as follows:

- `output.assetPrefix` only takes effect in the production build.
- `output.assetPrefix` automatically appends a trailing `/` by default.
- The value of `output.assetPrefix` is written to the [process.env.ASSET_PREFIX](/guide/advanced/env-vars#processenvasset_prefix) environment variable (can only be accessed in client code).
