# Preact Plugin

The Preact plugin provides support for Preact, integrating features such as JSX compilation and React aliasing.

## Quick Start

### Install Plugin

You can install the plugin using the following command:

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

<PackageManagerTabs command="add @rsbuild/plugin-preact -D" />

### Register Plugin

You can register the plugin in the `rsbuild.config.ts` file:

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
import { pluginPreact } from '@rsbuild/plugin-preact';

export default {
  plugins: [pluginPreact()],
};
```

After registering the plugin, you can directly develop Preact.
