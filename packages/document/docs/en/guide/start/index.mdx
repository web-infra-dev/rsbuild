# Introduction

**Rsbuild is an Rspack-based build tool for the web.** The main goal of Rsbuild is to provide out-of-the-box build capabilities for Rspack users, allowing developers to start a web project with zero configuration.

Rsbuild also provides universal build capabilities for higher level solutions, such as Rspress and Modern.js. In fact, Rsbuild is a rebrand of the Modern.js Builder. It has been decoupled from Modern.js to provide greater flexibility and to meet the diverse needs of community users.

## Features

### Support Rspack Build

**Rsbuild supports both Rspack and webpack**, so you can switch between the stable Webpack and the faster Rspack.

By default, Rsbuild uses Rspack as the bundler.

### Deep optimization

Rsbuild **makes full use of various optimization strategies** in the Rspack and webpack ecosystem to ensure the artifacts performance in the production environment.

Taking the chunk splitting scenario as an example, the Rspack's splitChunks config is complex, and Rsbuild makes it as an out-of-the-box [performance.chunkSplit](/config/options/performance.html#performancechunksplit) config, it will split common third-party libraries into chunks to make page loading faster.

### Extensible Plugin System

Provides rich configuration options and a flexible plugin system to support in-depth customization of all features.

For Rsbuild, all building abilities are achieved through plugins:

- Most of the plugins are lightweight, built in Rsbuild, and developers can enable or disable them through configs.
- Some plugins are more complex and developed as independent npm packages, developers can install and use them as needed.

Rsbuild also supports custom plugins, so framework developers can develop custom plugins to meet customized requirements.
