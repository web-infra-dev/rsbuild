# Introduction

## üí° What is Rsbuild?

- Rsbuild is an Rspack-based build tool for the web.
- Rsbuild is an enhanced Rspack CLI, which is more user-friendly and out-of-the-box.
- Rsbuild is the Rspack team's exploration and implementation of best practices for web building.
- Rsbuild is the best solution for migrating from Webpack to Rspack, reducing configuration by 90% and getting 10x build speed.

## üöÄ Performance

Rsbuild's build performance is on par with native Rspack. This is the time it takes to build 1000 React components:

## üî• Features

Rsbuild has the following features:

- **Easy to Configure**: One of the goals of Rsbuild is to provide out-of-the-box build capabilities for Rspack users, allowing developers to start a web project with zero configuration. In addition, Rsbuild provides semantic build configuration to reduce the learning curve for Rspack configuration.

- **Performance Oriented**: Rsbuild integrates high-performance Rust-based tools from the community, including [Rspack](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspack), [SWC](https://swc.rs/) and [Lightning CSS](https://lightningcss.dev/), to deliver top-notch build speed and development experience. Compared to webpack-based tools like Create React App and Vue CLI, Rsbuild provides 5 to 10 times faster build performance and lighter dependencies.

- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Rsbuild has a lightweight plugin system and includes a range of high-quality official plugins. Furthermore, Rsbuild is compatible with most webpack plugins and all Rspack plugins, allowing users to leverage existing community or in-house plugins in Rsbuild without the need for rewriting code.

- **Stable Artifacts**: Rsbuild is designed with a strong focus on the stability of build artifacts. It ensures high consistency between artifacts in the development and production builds, and automatically completes syntax downgrading and polyfill injection. Rsbuild also provides plugins for type checking and artifact syntax validation to prevent quality and compatibility issues in production code.

- **Framework Agnostic**: Rsbuild is not coupled with any front-end UI framework. It supports frameworks like React, Vue 3, Vue 2, Svelte, Solid, and Lit through plugins, and plans to support more UI frameworks from the community in the future.

## üéØ Position

In addition to being used as a build tool, Rsbuild also provides universal build capabilities for higher-level solutions, such as [Rspress](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspress) and [Modern.js](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/modern.js), allowing them to focus on the development of their own domain specific capabilities.

The following diagram illustrates the relationship between Rsbuild and other tools in the ecosystem:
