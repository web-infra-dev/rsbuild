## CSR

CSR stands for "Client-Side Rendering". It means that the page is rendered in the browser using JavaScript, and logic such as data fetching, templates, and routing is completed on the client side rather than the server.

In CSR, the server sends an empty HTML shell and some JavaScript scripts to the browser, and the browser fetching data from the server's API and renders dynamic content to the page.

## SSR

SSR stands for "Server-Side Rendering". It means that the HTML of the web page is generated by the server and sent to the client, rather than sending only an empty HTML shell and relying on JavaScript to generate the page content.

In traditional client-side rendering, the server sends an empty HTML shell and some JavaScript scripts to the client, and then fetching data from the server's API and fills the page with dynamic content. This leads to slow initial page loading times and is not conducive to user experience and SEO.

With SSR, the server generates HTML that already contains dynamic content and sends it to the client. This makes the initial page loading faster and more SEO-friendly, as search engines can crawl the rendered page.

## SWC

SWC (Speedy Web Compiler) is a transformer and minimizer for JavaScript and TypeScript based on Rust. SWC can provide the same abilities with Babel, and it's more than 10x faster than Babel.

Rsbuild supports SWC by default, power your web application with polyfill and minification.
