# Quick Start

## Environment preparation

import NodeVersion from '@en/shared/nodeVersion.md';

<NodeVersion />

## Use the Modern.js Framework

**The Modern.js Framework uses Rsbuild as its build tool by default**. If you are a business developer, you do not need to manually install Rsbuild, just create a Modern.js project and use all the features provided by Rsbuild.

```bash
npx @modern-js/create@latest my-app
```

Please refer to [Modern.js - Introduction](https://modernjs.dev/en/guides/get-started/introduction.html) and [Modern.js - Quick Start](https://modernjs.dev/en/guides/get-started/quick-start.html) to learn how to use Modern.js framework.

:::tip About the documentation
Modern.js framework documentation and Rsbuild documentation are deployed under two separate sites. If you encounter any build-related problems while using the Modern.js framework, you can always refer to the documentation of Rsbuild to find solutions.

## Usse the Rsbuild CLI Tool

Rsbuild provides a lightweight CLI tool that includes basic commands such as `dev` and `build`. It is primarily used for building non-React projects.

If your project is not based on the React, for example, if you are developing a Vue project, you can use the Rsbuild CLI tool to build your project.

Please refer to [Use Rsbuild CLI](/guide/basic/builder-cli) for more information on how to use it.

## Use Rsbuild in a Front-end Framework

If you are developing a front-end framework, you can use Rsbuild by following these steps:

### 1. Install Rsbuild

You need to install two packages:

- `@rsbuild/core`: This is the core package of Rsbuild, which exports the core API of Rsbuild.
- `@rsbuild/rspack-provider`: To provide the building capabilities based on Rspack.

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

<PackageManagerTabs command="add @rsbuild/core @rsbuild/rspack-provider -D" />

if you want to use webpack instead of Rspack, you can replace the `@rsbuild/rspack-provider` with `@rsbuild/webpack-provider`:

> When performing a version upgrade, please ensure that the Rsbuild and Provider packages you install are of the same version.

### 2. Create Rsbuild Instance

There are two steps to creating a Rsbuild instance:

First you need to initialize the Rsbuild Provider and pass in the `builderConfig` config object. Rsbuild provides a lot of configs that allow you to customize the build behavior. At this point, you don't need to know the specific content of the config, just pass in an empty object. You can find all available configs in [API - config](/en/api/#config).

- Initialize the Rspack Provider:

```ts
import { createRsbuild } from '@rsbuild/core';
import { builderWebpackProvider } from '@rsbuild/webpack-provider';

const provider = builderWebpackProvider({
  builderConfig: {
    // some configs
  },
});
```

- Initialize the Rspack Providerï¼š

```ts
import { createRsbuild } from '@rsbuild/core';
import { builderRspackProvider } from '@rsbuild/rspack-provider';

const provider = builderRspackProvider({
  builderConfig: {
    // some configs
  },
});
```

After getting the provider instance, you can call the `createRsbuild` method to create a Rsbuild instance object:

```ts
const builder = await createRsbuild(provider, {
  entry: {
    index: './src/index.ts',
  },
});
```

Except the `entry` option, the `createRsbuild` method also provides some other options, which you can learn more about in [API - createRsbuild](/en/api/builder-core.html#createbuilder).

### 3. Call Rsbuild Instance Method

The Rsbuild instance provides some methods, which you can use it according to the usage scenarios.

To start local development, it is recommended to use the [builder.startDevServer](/en/api/builder-instance.html#builder-startdevserver) method, which will start a local Dev Server.

```ts
await builder.startDevServer();
```

After successfully starting Dev Server, you can see the following logs:

```bash
info    Starting dev server...

  > Local:    http://localhost:8081
  > Network:  http://192.168.0.1:8081
```

To deploy the App to production environment, it is recommended to use the [builder.build](/en/api/builder-instance.html#builder-build) method, which will build the production outputs.

```ts
await builder.build();
```

> For more introduction of Rsbuild instance methods, please read the [Rsbuild Instance](/en/api/builder-instance.html) chapter.

After completing the above three steps, you have learned the basic usage of Rsbuild. Next, you can customize the build process through the Rsbuild plugin and Rsbuild configs.
