## Usse the Rsbuild CLI Tool

Rsbuild provides a lightweight CLI tool that includes basic commands such as `dev` and `build`. It is primarily used for building non-React projects.

If your project is not based on the React, for example, if you are developing a Vue project, you can use the Rsbuild CLI tool to build your project.

Please refer to [Use Rsbuild CLI](/guide/basic/builder-cli) for more information on how to use it.
