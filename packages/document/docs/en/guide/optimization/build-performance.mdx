# Improve Build Performance

Rsbuild optimizes build performance by default, but as the project becomes larger, you may encounter some build performance problems.

This document provides some optional speed-up strategies, developers can choose some of them to improve the build performance.

:::tip
The strategies in [Bundle Size Optimization](/guide/optimization/optimize-bundle) can also be used to improve build performance, so we won't repeat them here.

## Performance Profiling

Performing a performance analysis can help you identify performance bottlenecks in your project, allowing for targeted optimization.

### Node.js Profiling

In general, the performance overhead on the JS side will be greater than that on the Rust side, and you can use Node.js profiling to analyze the overhead on the JS side.

Run the following command in the project root:

```bash
# dev
node --cpu-prof ./node_modules/@rsbuild/core/bin/rsbuild.js dev

# build
node --cpu-prof ./node_modules/@rsbuild/core/bin/rsbuild.js build
```

The above commands will generate a cpuprofile file. We can use [speedscope](https://github.com/jlfwong/speedscope) to visualize this file:

```bash
# Install speedscope
npm install -g speedscope

# View cpuprofile content
# Replace the name with the local file name
speedscope CPU.date.000000.00000.0.001.cpuprofile
```

### Rspack Profiling

Rsbuild supports the use of the `RSPACK_PROFILE` environment variable for Rspack build performance profile.

```bash
# dev
RSPACK_PROFILE=ALL rsbuild dev

# build
RSPACK_PROFILE=ALL rsbuild build
```

This command will generate a `rspack-profile-${timestamp}` folder in the dist folder, and it will contain `logging.json`, `trace.json` and `jscpuprofile.json` files:

- `trace.json`: The time spent on each phase of the Rust side is recorded at a granular level using tracing and can be viewed using [ui.perfetto.dev](https://ui.perfetto.dev/).
- `jscpuprofile.json`: The time spent at each stage on the JavaScript side is recorded at a granular level using [Node.js inspector](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/inspector.html) and can be viewed using [speedscope.app](https://www.speedscope.app/).
- `logging.json`: Includes some logging information that keeps a coarse-grained record of how long each phase of the build took. (Not supported in development environment yet)

For more information about Rspack build performance analysis usage, please refer to [Rspack - Profiling](https://web-infra-dev.github.io/rspack-dev-guide/profiling/intro.html#profiling).

## General Optimization Strategy

The following are some general optimization strategies, which can speed up the development build and production build, and some of them also optimize the bundle size.

### Use Lightning CSS Plugin

Lightning CSS is a high performance CSS parser, transformer and minifier written in Rust. It supports parsing and transforming many modern CSS features into syntax supported by target browsers, and also provides a better compression ratio.

Rsbuild provides the [Lightning CSS Plugin](/plugins/list/plugin-lightningcss) which allows you to use [lightningcss](https://lightningcss.dev/) instead of the built-in `postcss-loader' to compile CSS, reducing the performance overhead of PostCSS and autoprefixer.

For projects with a large number of CSS files, enabling the Lightning CSS plugin can significantly improve overall build performance.

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
import { pluginLightningcss } from '@rsbuild/plugin-lightningcss';

export default {
  plugins: [pluginLightningcss()],
};
```

## Development optimization strategies

The following are strategies for improve build performance in development environment.

### Adjust Source Map format

In order to provide a good debugging experience, Rsbuild uses the `cheap-module-source-map` format Source Map by default during development, which is a high-quality Source Map format and will bring certain performance overhead.

You can improve build speed by adjusting the source map format of your development environment.

For example to disable Source Map:

```js
export default {
  output: {
    sourceMap: {
      js: false,
    },
  },
};
```

Or set the source map format of the development environment to the cheapest `eval` format:

```js
export default {
  output: {
    sourceMap: {
      js: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? 'eval' : false,
    },
  },
};
```

> For detailed differences between different Source Map formats, see [webpack - devtool](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/).

### Adjust Browserslist for development

This strategy is similar to ["Adjust Browserslist"](/guide/optimization/optimize-bundle#adjust-browserslist), the difference is that we can set different browserslist for development and production environment, thereby reducing the compilation overhead during development.

For example, you can add the following config to `.browserslistrc`, which means that only the latest browsers are compatible during development, and the actual browsers are compatible in the production environment:

```yaml title=".browserslistrc"
[production]
chrome >= 87
edge >= 88
firefox >= 78
safari >= 14

[development]
last 1 chrome version
last 1 firefox version
last 1 safari version
```

Note that this strategy can lead to some differences in the build result of development production environment.
