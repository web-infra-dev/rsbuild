# Use UnoCSS

[UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/) is the instant atomic CSS engine, that is designed to be flexible and extensible. The core is un-opinionated, and all the CSS utilities are provided via presets.

You can integrate UnoCSS in Rsbuild via PostCSS plugins.

## Installing UnoCSS

You need to install `unocss` and `@unocss/postcss` first.

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

<PackageManagerTabs command="add unocss @unocss/postcss -D" />

## Configuring PostCSS

You can register the `unocss` PostCSS plugin through [postcss.config.cjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-loader#config) or [tools.postcss](/config/tools/postcss).

```js title="postcss.config.cjs"
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    '@unocss/postcss': {},
  },
};
```

Rsbuild has integrated [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer), so you only need to register the `tailwindcss` plugin.

## Configuring UnoCSS

Create a `uno.config.ts` file in the root directory of your project and add the following content:

```js title="uno.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, presetUno } from 'unocss';

export default defineConfig({
  content: {
    filesystem: ['./src/**/*.{html,js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
  },
  presets: [presetUno()],
});
```

:::tip
The above configuration is for reference only and can be modified to suit the needs of your project.

## Importing CSS

Add the `@unocss` directives in your CSS entry file:

```css title="main.css"
@unocss preflights;
@unocss default;
```

Depending on your needs, you can selectively import the CSS styles provided by UnoCSS. Please refer to the [unocss documentation](https://unocss.dev/integrations/postcss#usage) for detailed usage of the UnoCSS.

## Done

You have now completed all the steps to integrate UnoCSS in Rsbuild!

You can use UnoCSS's utility classes in any component or HTML, such as:

```html
<h1 class="px-2 items-center justify-between">Hello world!</h1>
```

For more usage details, refer to the [UnoCSS documentation](https://unocss.dev/).

## VS Code Extension

UnoCSS provides a [VSCode Extension](https://unocss.dev/integrations/vscode) plugin for VS Code to decoration and tooltip for matched utilities.

You can install this plugin in VS Code to enable more intelligent features.
