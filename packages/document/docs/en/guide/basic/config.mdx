# Rsbuild Config

Rsbuild provides a wealth of configs to help users customize the build behavior.

## Config Categories

Rsbuild Configs are divided into the following categories:

- [Dev](/config/options/dev.html): Config related to local development.
- [Html](/config/options/html.html): Config related to HTML.
- [Tools](/config/options/tools.html): Config related to the low-level tools.
- [Source](/config/options/source.html): Config related to source code parsing and compilation.
- [Output](/config/options/output.html): Config related to output.
- [Security](/config/options/security.html): Config related to security.
- [Performance](/config/options/performance.html): Config related to performance.
- [Experiments](/config/options/experiments.html): Config in experimental stage.

You can find detailed descriptions of all configs on the [Config](/config/) page.

## Default Values

The Rsbuild presets a default value for each config, and the default value is suitable for most scenarios. At the same time, the upper-level framework will also override some of the default values based on the requirements of the vertical scene.

In most cases, you don't need to define any Rsbuild config, just use it right out of the box.

## Use Config

### In the Upper Framework

When you use a Rsbuild-based upper-level framework, you can define the Rsbuild config directly through the framework's config file, and the upper-level framework will pass the config to the Rsbuild.

For example, in the Modern.js framework, you can define the Rsbuild's [source.alias](/config/options/source.html#sourcealias) config in [modern.config.ts](https://modernjs.dev/en/configure/app/usage.html) file.

```ts title="modern.config.ts"
export default {
  source: {
    alias: {
      '@common': './src/common',
    },
  },
};
```

### Using the Node API

When you call the Rsbuild through the Node API, you can pass in the Rsbuild config through the Provider's `rsbuildConfig` option:

```ts
import { webpackProvider } from '@rsbuild/webpack';

const provider = webpackProvider({
  rsbuildConfig: {
    // some configs
  },
});
```

Please refer to [API - createRsbuild](/api/javascript-api/core.html#creatersbuild) for details.

## Debug the config

You can enable Rsbuild's debug mode by adding the `DEBUG=rsbuild` environment variable when executing a build.

```bash
DEBUG=rsbuild pnpm dev
```

In debug mode, Rsbuild will write the Rsbuild config to the dist directory, which is convenient for developers to view and debug.

```
Inspect config succeed, open the following files to view the content:

   - Rsbuild Config: /Project/demo/dist/rsbuild.config.js
   - Rspack Config (web): /Project/demo/dist/rspack.config.web.js
```

Open the generated `/dist/rsbuild.config.js` file to see the complete content of the Rsbuild config.

For a complete introduction to debug mode, see the [Debug Mode](/guide/debug/debug-mode.html) chapter.
