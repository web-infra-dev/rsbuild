# Use TypeScript

Rsbuild supports TypeScript by default, allowing you to directly use `.ts` and `.tsx` files in your projects.

## TypeScript Transpilation

Rsbuild uses SWC by default for transpiling TypeScript code, and it also supports switching to Babel for transpilation.

### isolatedModules

Unlike the native TypeScript compiler, tools like SWC and Babel compile each file separately and cannot determine whether an imported name is a type or a value. Therefore, when using TypeScript in Rsbuild, you need to enable the [isolatedModules](https://typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#isolatedModules) option in your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "isolatedModules": true
  }
}
```

This option can help you avoid using certain syntax that cannot be correctly compiled by SWC and Babel, such as cross-file type references. It will guide you to correct the corresponding usage:

```ts
// Wrong
export { SomeType } from './types';

// Correct
export type { SomeType } from './types';
```

## Type Checking

When transpiling TypeScript code using tools like SWC and Babel, type checking is not performed.

Rsbuild provides the Type Check plugin, which runs TypeScript type checking in a separate process. The plugin internally integrates [fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/TypeStrong/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin).

Please refer to the [Type Check plugin](/plugins/list/plugin-type-check) for usage instructions.
