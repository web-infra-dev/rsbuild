# Create React App

This chapter introduces how to migrate a [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (CRA) project to Rsbuild.

## Installing Dependencies

First, you need to replace the npm dependencies of CRA with Rsbuild's dependencies.

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

Remove CRA dependencies:

<PackageManagerTabs command="remove react-scripts" />

Install Rsbuild dependencies:

<PackageManagerTabs command="add @rsbuild/core @rsbuild/plugin-react -D" />

## Updating npm scripts

Next, you need to update the npm scripts in package.json to Rsbuild's CLI commands.

```diff title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
-   "start": "react-scripts start",
-   "build": "react-scripts build",
-   "eject": "react-scripts eject"
+   "start": "rsbuild dev",
+   "build": "rsbuild build",
+   "preview": "rsbuild preview"
  }
}
```

:::tip
Rsbuild does not integrate testing frameworks, so it does not provide a command to replace `react-scripts test`. You can directly use testing frameworks such as Jest or Vitest.

## Creating Configuration File

Create a Rsbuild configuration file `rsbuild.config.ts` in the same directory as package.json and add the following content:

```typescript title="rsbuild.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@rsbuild/core';
import { pluginReact } from '@rsbuild/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [pluginReact()],
});
```

This completes the basic migration from CRA to Rsbuild. You can now run the `npm run start` command to try starting the development server.

## Using SVGR

If you are using the "SVG to React Component" feature of CRA (i.e., [SVGR](https://react-svgr.com/)), you also need to install the SVGR plugin for Rsbuild.

For example, if you are using the following usage:

```jsx
import { ReactComponent as Logo } from './logo.svg';

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <Logo />
  </div>
);
```

Please refer to the [SVGR plugin](/plugins/list/plugin-svgr) documentation to learn how to use SVGR in Rsbuild.
