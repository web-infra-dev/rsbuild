## Transform API

Rsbuild plugin now supports the [transform API](/plugins/dev/core#apitransform), which can be thought of as a lightweight implementation of Rspack loader. It provides a simple and easy to use API and automatically calls Rspack loader at the backend to transform the code.

In Rsbuild plugins, you can quickly implement code transformation functions using `api.transform`, which can handle the majority of common scenarios without having to learn how to write an Rspack loader.

For example, match modules with the `.pug` extension and transform them to JavaScript code:

```ts
import pug from 'pug';

const pluginPug = () => ({
  name: 'my-pug-plugin',
  setup(api) {
    api.transform({ test: /\.pug$/ }, ({ code }) => {
      const templateCode = pug.compileClient(code, {});
      return `${templateCode}; module.exports = template;`;
    });
  },
});
```

For some complex code transformation scenarios, `api.transform` may not be sufficient. In such situations, you can implement it using the Rspack loader.
