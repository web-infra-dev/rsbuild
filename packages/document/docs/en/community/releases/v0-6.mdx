# Announcing Rsbuild v0.6

> April 10, 2024

![](https://rsfamily-design-resources.netlify.app/rsbuild/rsbuild-banner-v0-6.png)

Main changes:

- Error overlay enabled by default
- New transform plugin API
- Default port changed to 3000

---

## Error overlay enabled by default

Starting from Rsbuild v0.6, the default value of [dev.client.overlay](/config/dev/client) has been adjusted to `true`. This means that when a compilation error occurs, Rsbuild will pop up the error overlay by default to display the error information:

If you do not need this feature, you can set `dev.client.overlay` to `false` to disable it.

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  dev: {
    client: {
      overlay: false,
    },
  },
});
```

## New transform API

Rsbuild plugin now supports the [transform API](/plugins/dev/core#apitransform), which can be thought of as a lightweight implementation of Rspack loader. It provides a simple and easy to use API and automatically calls Rspack loader at the backend to transform the code.

In Rsbuild plugins, you can quickly implement code transformation functions using `api.transform`, which can handle the majority of common scenarios without having to learn how to write an Rspack loader.

For example, match modules with the `.pug` extension and transform them to JavaScript code:

```ts
import pug from 'pug';

const pluginPug = () => ({
  name: 'my-pug-plugin',
  setup(api) {
    api.transform({ test: /\.pug$/ }, ({ code }) => {
      const templateCode = pug.compileClient(code, {});
      return `${templateCode}; module.exports = template;`;
    });
  },
});
```

For some complex code transformation scenarios, `api.transform` may not be sufficient. In such situations, you can implement it using the Rspack loader.

## Default port changed to 3000

Rsbuild has changed the default value of [server.port](/config/server/port) from `8080` to `3000`.

Port 3000 is commonly used for web development, and is also the default port used by tools such as create-react-app. Changing the default port to 3000 can prevent possible port conflicts when using 8080.

If you need to use port 8080, you can manually set it as follows:

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    port: 8080,
  },
});
```
