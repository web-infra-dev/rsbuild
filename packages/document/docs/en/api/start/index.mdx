# JavaScript API

Rsbuild provides a complete set of JavaScript APIs for developers to build higher level solutions on top of Rsbuild.

## Access Example

Here is a basic example of how to access the Rsbuild JavaScript API.

### 1. Install Rsbuild

You need to install the `@rsbuild/core` package:

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

<PackageManagerTabs command="add @rsbuild/core -D" />

### 2. Create an Rsbuild Instance

You can call the `createRsbuild` method to create an Rsbuild instance and set the application entry point using the `entry` option:

```ts
import { createRsbuild } from '@rsbuild/core';

const rsbuild = await createRsbuild({
  entry: {
    index: './src/index.ts',
  },
});
```

Apart from the `entry` option mentioned in the example above, the `createRsbuild` method has several other options, which you can learn more about in the [API - createRsbuild](/api/javascript-api/core.html#creatersbuild).

### 3. Call Rsbuild Instance Method

The Rsbuild instance provides some methods, which you can use it according to the usage scenarios.

To start local development, it is recommended to use the [rsbuild.startDevServer](/api/javascript-api/instance.html#rsbuild-startdevserver) method, which will start a local Dev Server.

```ts
await rsbuild.startDevServer();
```

After successfully starting Dev Server, you can see the following logs:

```bash
  > Local:    http://localhost:8081
  > Network:  http://192.168.0.1:8081
```

To deploy the App to production environment, it is recommended to use the [rsbuild.build](/api/javascript-api/instance.html#rsbuild-build) method, which will build the production outputs.

```ts
await rsbuild.build();
```

> For more introduction of Rsbuild instance methods, please read the [Rsbuild Instance](/api/javascript-api/instance) chapter.

After completing the above three steps, you have learned the basic usage of Rsbuild. Next, you can customize the build process through the Rsbuild plugin and Rsbuild configs.
