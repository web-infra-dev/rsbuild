# JavaScript API

Rsbuild provides a complete set of JavaScript APIs for developers to build higher level solutions on top of Rsbuild.

## Access Example

Here is a basic example of how to access the Rsbuild JavaScript API.

### 1. Install Rsbuild

You need to install two packages:

- `@rsbuild/core`: This is the core package of Rsbuild, which exports the core API of Rsbuild.
- `@rsbuild/rspack-provider`: To provide the building capabilities based on Rspack.

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

<PackageManagerTabs command="add @rsbuild/core @rsbuild/rspack-provider -D" />

if you want to use webpack instead of Rspack, you can replace the `@rsbuild/rspack-provider` with `@rsbuild/webpack-provider`:

> When performing a version upgrade, please ensure that the Rsbuild and Provider packages you install are of the same version.

### 2. Create Rsbuild Instance

There are two steps to creating a Rsbuild instance:

First you need to initialize the Rsbuild Provider and pass in the `builderConfig` config object. Rsbuild provides a lot of configs that allow you to customize the build behavior. At this point, you don't need to know the specific content of the config, just pass in an empty object. You can find all available configs in [Config](/config/).

- Initialize the Rspack Provider:

```ts
import { createRsbuild } from '@rsbuild/core';
import { builderWebpackProvider } from '@rsbuild/webpack-provider';

const provider = builderWebpackProvider({
  builderConfig: {
    // some configs
  },
});
```

- Initialize the Rspack Providerï¼š

```ts
import { createRsbuild } from '@rsbuild/core';
import { builderRspackProvider } from '@rsbuild/rspack-provider';

const provider = builderRspackProvider({
  builderConfig: {
    // some configs
  },
});
```

After getting the provider instance, you can call the `createRsbuild` method to create a Rsbuild instance object:

```ts
const builder = await createRsbuild(provider, {
  entry: {
    index: './src/index.ts',
  },
});
```

Except the `entry` option, the `createRsbuild` method also provides some other options, which you can learn more about in [API - createRsbuild](/api/javascript-api/core.html#createbuilder).

### 3. Call Rsbuild Instance Method

The Rsbuild instance provides some methods, which you can use it according to the usage scenarios.

To start local development, it is recommended to use the [rsbuild.startDevServer](/api/javascript-api/instance.html#rsbuild-startdevserver) method, which will start a local Dev Server.

```ts
await rsbuild.startDevServer();
```

After successfully starting Dev Server, you can see the following logs:

```bash
info    Starting dev server...

  > Local:    http://localhost:8081
  > Network:  http://192.168.0.1:8081
```

To deploy the App to production environment, it is recommended to use the [rsbuild.build](/api/javascript-api/instance.html#rsbuild-build) method, which will build the production outputs.

```ts
await rsbuild.build();
```

> For more introduction of Rsbuild instance methods, please read the [Rsbuild Instance](/api/javascript-api/instance.html) chapter.

After completing the above three steps, you have learned the basic usage of Rsbuild. Next, you can customize the build process through the Rsbuild plugin and Rsbuild configs.
