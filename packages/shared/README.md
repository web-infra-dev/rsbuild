# Rsbuild Shared

The internal shared modules and dependencies of Rsbuild.

## Note

The `@rsbuild/shared` is used internally by Rsbuild. Please avoid relying on the methods exported by `@rsbuild/shared` in web projects or community plugins.

If you need to use the methods in `@rsbuild/shared`, you can directly copy the relevant code into your project, or you can provide feedback through issues. We will evaluate whether there is a need to provide an external API.
