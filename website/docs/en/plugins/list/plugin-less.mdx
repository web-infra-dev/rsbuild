# Less Plugin

import { SourceCode } from 'rspress/theme';

<SourceCode href="https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rsbuild/tree/main/packages/plugin-less" />

Use [Less](https://lesscss.org/) as the CSS preprocessor, implemented based on [less-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader).

## Quick Start

### Install Plugin

You can install the plugin using the following command:

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

<PackageManagerTabs command="add @rsbuild/plugin-less -D" />

:::tip

- The Less plugin only supports @rsbuild/core versions >= 0.7.0.
- If the @rsbuild/core version is lower than 0.7.0, it has builtin support for the Less plugin, you do not need to install it.

:::

### Register Plugin

You can register the plugin in the `rsbuild.config.ts` file:

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
import { pluginLess } from '@rsbuild/plugin-less';

export default {
  plugins: [pluginLess()],
};
```

After registering the plugin, you can import `*.less` or `*.module.less` files into the code without adding other configs.

## Options

If you need to customize the compilation behavior of Less, you can use the following configs.

### lessLoaderOptions

You can modify the config of [less-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader) via `lessLoaderOptions`.

- **Type:** `Object | Function`
- **Default:**

```js
const defaultOptions = {
  lessOptions: {
    javascriptEnabled: true,
    paths: [path.join(rootPath, 'node_modules')],
  },
  implementation: require.resolve('less'),
  sourceMap: rsbuildConfig.output.sourceMap.css,
};
```

- **Example:**

If `lessLoaderOptions` is an object, it is merged with the default config through `Object.assign` in a shallow way. It should be noted that `lessOptions` is merged through deepMerge in a deep way.

```js
pluginLess({
  lessLoaderOptions: {
    javascriptEnabled: false,
  },
});
```

If `lessLoaderOptions` is a function, the default config is passed as the first parameter, which can be directly modified or returned as the final result.

```js
pluginLess({
  lessLoaderOptions(config) {
    config.lessOptions = {
      javascriptEnabled: false,
    };
  },
});
```

### exclude

- **Type:** [RuleSetCondition](https://rspack.dev/config/module#condition)
- **Default:** `undefined`

Exclude some `.less` files, they will not be transformed by `less-loader`.

For example:

```ts
pluginLess({
  exclude: /some-folder[\\/]foo\.less/,
});
```

## Modifying Less Version

In some scenarios, if you need to use a specific version of Less instead of the built-in Less v4 in Rsbuild, you can install the desired Less version in your project and set it up using the `implementation` option of the `less-loader`.

```js
pluginLess({
  lessLoaderOptions: {
    implementation: require('less'),
  },
});
```
