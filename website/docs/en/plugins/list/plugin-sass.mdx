# Sass Plugin

import { SourceCode } from 'rspress/theme';

<SourceCode href="https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rsbuild/tree/main/packages/plugin-sass" />

Use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) as the CSS preprocessor, implemented based on [sass-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader).

## Quick Start

### Install Plugin

You can install the plugin using the following command:

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

<PackageManagerTabs command="add @rsbuild/plugin-sass -D" />

:::tip

- The Sass plugin only supports @rsbuild/core versions >= 0.7.0.
- If the @rsbuild/core version is lower than 0.7.0, it has builtin support for the Sass plugin, you do not need to install it.

:::

### Register Plugin

You can register the plugin in the `rsbuild.config.ts` file:

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
import { pluginSass } from '@rsbuild/plugin-sass';

export default {
  plugins: [pluginSass()],
};
```

After registering the plugin, you can import `*.scss`, `*.sass`, `*.module.scss` or `*.module.sass` files into the code without adding other configs.

## Options

If you need to customize the compilation behavior of Sass, you can use the following configs.

### sassLoaderOptions

Modify the config of [sass-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader).

- **Type:** `Object | Function`
- **Default:**

```js
const defaultOptions = {
  api: 'modern-compiler',
  implementation: require.resolve('sass-embedded'),
  sourceMap: rsbuildConfig.output.sourceMap.css,
};
```

- **Example:**

If `sassLoaderOptions` is an object, it is merged with the default config through `Object.assign`. It should be noted that `sassOptions` is merged through deepMerge in a deep way.

```js
pluginSass({
  sassLoaderOptions: {
    sourceMap: true,
  },
});
```

If `sassLoaderOptions` is a function, the default config is passed as the first parameter, which can be directly modified or returned as the final result.

```js
pluginSass({
  sassLoaderOptions(config) {
    config.additionalData = async (content, loaderContext) => {
      // ...
    };
  },
});
```

### exclude

- **Type:** [RuleSetCondition](https://rspack.dev/config/module#condition)
- **Default:** `undefined`

Exclude some `.sass` or `.scss` files, they will not be transformed by `sass-loader`.

For example:

```ts
pluginSass({
  exclude: /some-folder[\\/]foo\.scss/,
});
```

## Custom Sass

### Sass Implementation

Sass provides several implementations, including [sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass), [sass-embedded](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass-embedded), and [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass).

Rsbuild uses the latest `sass-embedded` implementation by default. `sass-embedded` is a JavaScript wrapper around the native Dart Sass executable, providing a consistent API and optimal performance.

If you need to use a different Sass implementation instead of the built-in `sass-embedded` included in Rsbuild, you can install the preferred Sass implementation in your project and specify it using the `sass-loader`'s [implementation](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader?tab=readme-ov-file#implementation) option.

```ts
pluginSass({
  sassLoaderOptions: {
    implementation: require.resolve('sass'),
  },
});
```

:::tip
Switching from `sass-embedded` to another Sass implementation can significantly decrease build performance.

### Sass API

Rsbuild uses the latest `modern-compiler` API by default. If you rely on the `legacy` API of Sass, you can set the `api` option of the sass-loader to `legacy` to maintain compatibility with some deprecated Sass syntax.

```ts
pluginSass({
  sassLoaderOptions: {
    api: 'legacy',
  },
});
```

:::tip
Sass's `legacy` API has been deprecated and will be removed in Sass 2.0. It is recommended to migrate to the `modern-compiler` API. For more details, see [Sass - Legacy JS API](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/legacy-js-api/).
