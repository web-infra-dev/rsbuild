# Sass Plugin

import { SourceCode } from 'rspress/theme';

<SourceCode href="https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rsbuild/tree/main/packages/plugin-sass" />

Use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) as the CSS preprocessor, implemented based on [sass-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader).

## Quick Start

### Install Plugin

You can install the plugin using the following command:

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

<PackageManagerTabs command="add @rsbuild/plugin-sass -D" />

:::tip

- The Sass plugin only supports @rsbuild/core versions >= 0.7.0.
- If the @rsbuild/core version is lower than 0.7.0, it has builtin support for the Sass plugin, you do not need to install it.

:::

### Register Plugin

You can register the plugin in the `rsbuild.config.ts` file:

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
import { pluginSass } from '@rsbuild/plugin-sass';

export default {
  plugins: [pluginSass()],
};
```

After registering the plugin, you can import `*.scss`, `*.sass`, `*.module.scss` or `*.module.sass` files into the code without adding other configs.

## Options

If you need to customize the compilation behavior of Sass, you can use the following configs.

### sassLoaderOptions

Modify the config of [sass-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader).

- **Type:** `Object | Function`
- **Default:**

```js
const defaultOptions = {
  api: 'modern-compiler',
  implementation: require.resolve('sass-embedded'),
  sourceMap: rsbuildConfig.output.sourceMap.css,
};
```

- **Example:**

If `sassLoaderOptions` is an object, it is merged with the default config through `Object.assign`. It should be noted that `sassOptions` is merged through deepMerge in a deep way.

```js
pluginSass({
  sassLoaderOptions: {
    sourceMap: true,
  },
});
```

If `sassLoaderOptions` is a function, the default config is passed as the first parameter, which can be directly modified or returned as the final result.

```js
pluginSass({
  sassLoaderOptions(config) {
    config.additionalData = async (content, loaderContext) => {
      // ...
    };
  },
});
```

### include

- **Type:** [RuleSetCondition](https://rspack.dev/config/module#condition)
- **Default:** `/\.s(?:a|c)ss$/`
- **Version:** `>= 1.1.0`

Include some `.scss` or `.sass` files, they will be transformed by `sass-loader`. The value is the same as the `rule.test` option in Rspack.

For example:

```ts
pluginSass({
  include: /\.custom\.scss$/,
});
```

### exclude

- **Type:** [RuleSetCondition](https://rspack.dev/config/module#condition)
- **Default:** `undefined`

Exclude some `.sass` or `.scss` files, they will not be transformed by `sass-loader`.

For example:

```ts
pluginSass({
  exclude: /some-folder[\\/]foo\.scss/,
});
```

## Custom Sass

### Sass Implementation

Sass provides several implementations, including [sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass), [sass-embedded](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass-embedded), and [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass).

Rsbuild uses the latest `sass-embedded` implementation by default. `sass-embedded` is a JavaScript wrapper around the native Dart Sass executable, providing a consistent API and optimal performance.

If you need to use a different Sass implementation instead of the built-in `sass-embedded` included in Rsbuild, you can install the preferred Sass implementation in your project and specify it using the `sass-loader`'s [implementation](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader?tab=readme-ov-file#implementation) option.

```ts
pluginSass({
  sassLoaderOptions: {
    implementation: require.resolve('sass'),
  },
});
```

:::tip
Switching from `sass-embedded` to another Sass implementation can significantly decrease build performance.
:::

### Sass API

Rsbuild uses the latest `modern-compiler` API by default. If you rely on the `legacy` API of Sass, you can set the `api` option of the sass-loader to `legacy` to maintain compatibility with some deprecated Sass syntax.

```ts
pluginSass({
  sassLoaderOptions: {
    api: 'legacy',
  },
});
```

:::tip
Sass's `legacy` API has been deprecated and will be removed in Sass 2.0. It is recommended to migrate to the `modern-compiler` API. For more details, see [Sass - Legacy JS API](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/legacy-js-api/).
:::

## Sass Deprecation Warnings

Sass uses warning logs to notify you of deprecated usages that will be removed in future major releases of Sass. It is recommended to make changes as suggested by the logs. If you do not want to see these logs, you can ignore these warnings by using the [silenceDeprecations](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/stringoptions/#silenceDeprecations) option in Sass.

For example, `@import` has been deprecated in Sass. If you use this syntax, Sass will output the following prompt:

```
Sass @import rules are deprecated and will be removed in Dart Sass 3.0.0.

More info and automated migrator: https://sass-lang.com/d/import

 0 | @import './b.scss';
```

You can suppress the `@import` warning with the following configuration:

```ts
pluginSass({
  sassLoaderOptions: {
    sassOptions: {
      silenceDeprecations: ['import'],
    },
  },
});
```
