# dev.watchFiles

- **Type:**

```ts
type WatchFiles = {
  paths: string | string[];
  // watch options for chokidar
  options?: WatchOptions;
};
```

- **Default:** `undefined`

Watch files and directories for changes. When a file changes, the page will be reloaded.

If both `dev.hmr` and `dev.liveReload` are set to false, `watchFiles` will be ignored.

### Prerequisite knowledge

By default, Rsbuild (Rspack) watching all build dependencies and triggers a recompilation when any of these files change. If you want changes in non-build dependency files to cause the page to reload, you can configure this configuration.

It's important to note that changes in files listed under `WatchFiles` do not trigger a reload of the configuration file or a rebuild.

Furthermore, if you want changes in a build dependency file to not trigger a recompilation, you can use the [watchOptions.ignored]((https://www.rspack.dev/config/watch#watchoptionsignored) setting in Rspack.

For instance, if you want to prevent a rebuild when files in the `node_modules` directory change, you can configure it as follows:

```js
export default {
  tools: {
    bundlerChain: (chain) => {
      chain.watchOptions({
        ignored: /node_modules/,
      });
    },
  },
};
```

### Example

You can configure a list of globs/directories/files to watch for file changes.

```js
export default {
  dev: {
    watchFiles: {
      // watch a single file
      paths: 'public/demo.txt',
      // use a glob pattern
      paths: 'src/**/*.txt',
      // watch multiple file paths
      paths: ['src/**/*.txt', 'public/**/*'],
    },
  },
};
```

You can also specify [chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar#api) watcher options by passing an object with `paths` and `options` properties.

```js
export default {
  dev: {
    watchFiles: {
      paths: 'src/**/*.txt',
      options: {
        usePolling: false,
      },
    },
  },
};
```
