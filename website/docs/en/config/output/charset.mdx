# output.charset

- **Type:** `'ascii' | 'utf8'`
- **Default:** `'utf8'`

The `charset` config allows you to specify the [character encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Character_encoding) for output files to ensure they are displayed correctly in different environments.

## UTF8

By default, the output of Rsbuild is encoded in [UTF-8](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/UTF-8), which is the most commonly used character encoding in web applications.

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
export default {
  output: {
    charset: 'utf8', // This is the default
  },
};
```

When your web server returns the resource, please ensure that it sends the correct [Content-Type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type) response header so that the browser can parse it correctly.

## ASCII

If you want the output files to use [ASCII](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/ASCII) encoding, you can set this in the config file like this:

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
export default {
  output: {
    charset: 'ascii',
  },
};
```

When using ASCII encoding, all non-ASCII characters are escaped with backslashes, which may make the files slightly larger and harder to read.

## Notes

Currently, the `charset` option only affects files compiled with [SWC](/guide/configuration/swc), which by default includes JavaScript and TypeScript files. However, HTML and CSS files are not affected by the `charset` option.

For HTML files, Rsbuild adds a `<meta charset="utf-8">` tag by default. You can change this using the [html.meta](/config/html/meta) option.
