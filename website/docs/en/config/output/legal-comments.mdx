# output.legalComments

- **Type:** `'linked' | 'inline' | 'none'`
- **Default:** `'linked'`

Controls how legal comments are handled in the build output.

## What are legal comments?

A "legal comment" is any statement-level comment in JS or rule-level comment in CSS that contains @license or @preserve, or that starts with //! or /\*!. These comments are preserved in output files by default since that follows the intent of the original authors of the code.

For example, the `LICENSE` comment in React:

```js
/**
 * @license React
 * react.production.js
 *
 * Copyright (c) Meta Platforms, Inc. and affiliates.
 *
 * This source code is licensed under the MIT license found in the
 * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.
 */
```

## Optional values

You can control how legal comments are handled using these options:

### `linked`

Extracts all legal comments to `*.LICENSE.txt` files and links to them with a comment.

```js title="rsbuild.config.js"
export default {
  output: {
    legalComments: 'linked',
  },
};
```

`.LICENSE.txt` files are not loaded by the page, so they will not affect the page's performance.

### `inline`

Preserves all legal comments in their original position. This may increase the size of the output bundles.

```js title="rsbuild.config.js"
export default {
  output: {
    legalComments: 'inline',
  },
};
```

### `none`

Removes all legal comments.

```js title="rsbuild.config.js"
export default {
  output: {
    legalComments: 'none',
  },
};
```

:::tip
Removing license comments may violate the terms of some software licenses. Please ensure you have the right to remove these comments before using this option.
