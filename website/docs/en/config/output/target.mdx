# output.target

- **Type:**

```ts
type RsbuildTarget = 'web' | 'node' | 'web-worker';
```

- **Default:** `'web'`
- **Version:** `>= 1.0.0`

Setting the build target of Rsbuild.

Rsbuild supports multiple build targets for running in different environments. After setting the target type, the default configuration of Rsbuild will change accordingly.

## Default target

By default, the target is set to 'web' and will build outputs for running in the browser.

Rsbuild will read the [Browserslist config](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) in the project to determine the range of browsers.

## Optional values

In addition to `'web'`, `target` can also be set to the following values:

- `'node'`: Build for Node.js environment, usually used in SSR or other scenarios.
- `'web-worker'`: Build for Web Workers environment.

For example, to build for the Node.js environment:

```ts
export default {
  output: {
    target: 'node',
  },
};
```

## Parallel builds

You can use [environments](/config/environments) to build multiple targets in parallel.

For example, to build `web` outputs and `node` outputs at the same time:

```ts
export default {
  environments: {
    web: {
      output: {
        target: 'web',
      },
    },
    node: {
      output: {
        target: 'node',
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## Node target

Refers to the build target running in the Node.js environment, usually used in scenarios such as SSR.

When `target` is set to `'node'`, Rsbuild will:

- Set Rspack's [target](https://rspack.rs/config/target) to `'node'`.
- No HTML files will be generated, and HTML-related logic will not be executed, since HTML is not required by the Node.js environment.
- The default code split strategy will be disabled, but dynamic import can still work.
- Disable the HMR.
- Set the default value of Browserslist to `['node >= 16']`.
- Set the default value of [output.emitCss](/config/output/emit-css) to `false`. This means that CSS code will not be extracted to separate files, but the id information of CSS Modules will be included in the bundle.

### Node addons

When `target` is set to `'node'`, Rsbuild allows you to import Node.js [Addons](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html) in JavaScript files.

For example:

```js title="src/index.js"
import addon from './addon.node';

addon.doSomething();
```

The referenced addons file will be output to the `dist` directory:

```
dist/index.js
dist/addon.node
```

## Web Workers target

Refers to the build target running in the [Web Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) environment.

When `target` is set to `'web-worker'`, Rsbuild will:

- Set Rspack's [target](https://rspack.rs/config/target) to `'webworker'`.
- No HTML files will be generated, and HTML-related logic will not be executed, since HTML is not required by the Web Worker environment.
- CSS code will not be bundled or extracted, but the id information of CSS Modules will be included in the bundle (the default value of [output.emitCss](/config/output/emit-css) is `false`).
- The default code split strategy will be disabled, and **dynamic import cannot work**, because the Web Worker only runs a single JavaScript file.
- Set the default value of [output.emitCss](/config/output/emit-css) to `false`. This means that CSS code will not be extracted to separate files, but the id information of CSS Modules will be included in the bundle.
- Disable the HMR.

For more information, please refer to: [Using Web Workers](/guide/basic/web-workers).

## Other targets

[Rspack](https://rspack.rs/config/target) supports other target types, such as `electron-main` and `electron-renderer`.

Rsbuild currently does not support these targets. You can configure these targets using [tools.rspack](/config/tools/rspack).

For example, setting the `target` to `'electron-main'` will override the default `'web'` set by Rsbuild.

```js
export default {
  tools: {
    rspack: {
      target: 'electron-main',
    },
  },
};
```
