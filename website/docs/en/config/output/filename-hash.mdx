# output.filenameHash

- **Type:** `boolean | string`
- **Default:** `true`

Whether to add a hash value to the filename after the production build.

### Disable hash

By default, the filename of the output files will include a hash value:

```bash
dist/static/css/index.7879e19d.css
dist/static/js/index.18a568e5.js
```

You can set `output.filenameHash` to false to disable this behavior:

```js
export default {
  output: {
    filenameHash: false,
  },
};
```

After rebuilding, the output filenames becomes:

```bash
dist/static/css/index.css
dist/static/js/index.js
```

### Hash format

The default hash format is `contenthash:8`, which generates an 8-bit hash based on the content of the file.

You can set `output.filenameHash` to other formats supported by Rspack and customize the length.

```js
export default {
  output: {
    filenameHash: 'fullhash:16',
  },
};
```

The optional hash formats are:

- `fullhash`: The hash value of the entire compilation. If any file changes, the hash values of all output files in the entire project will change.
- `chunkhash`: The hash value of the chunk. The hash value will only change when the content of the chunk (and its included modules) changes.
- `contenthash`: The hash value of the file content. The hash value will only change when the content of the file itself changes.

### Notes

- [output.filename](/config/output/filename) has a higher priority than `output.filenameHash`.
- By default, when the target is not `web`, the hash will not be included in the filename of the output files, such as Node.js bundles.
- By default, the filename in development mode does not include a hash.
