# output.polyfill

- **Type:** `'entry' | 'usage' | 'off'`
- **Default:** `'off'`

Through the `output.polyfill` option, you can control the injection mode of the polyfills.

> In Rsbuild v0.x, the default value of `output.polyfill` was `'usage'`. Starting from Rsbuild v1.x, the default value is `'off'`.

## Optional Value

### usage

When `output.polyfill` is configured as `'usage'`, Rsbuild will inject the polyfills based on the APIs used in each file.

```ts
export default {
  output: {
    polyfill: 'usage',
  },
};
```

### entry

When `output.polyfill` is configured as `'entry'`, Rsbuild will inject the polyfills in each entry file.

```ts
export default {
  output: {
    polyfill: 'entry',
  },
};
```

### off

When `output.polyfill` is configured as `'off'`, Rsbuild will not inject the polyfills, and developers need to ensure code compatibility themselves.

```ts
export default {
  output: {
    polyfill: 'off',
  },
};
```
