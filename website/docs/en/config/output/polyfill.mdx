# output.polyfill

- **Type:** `'entry' | 'usage' | 'off'`
- **Default:** `'off'`

Controls the polyfill injection mode.

> See [Polyfill Mode](/guide/advanced/browser-compatibility#polyfill-mode) for more details.

## Optional value

### usage

With `output.polyfill` set to `'usage'`, Rsbuild injects polyfills based on the APIs used in each file. This provides optimal bundle size by including only needed polyfills.

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
export default {
  output: {
    polyfill: 'usage',
  },
};
```

### entry

With `output.polyfill` set to `'entry'`, Rsbuild injects polyfills in each entry file. This ensures all polyfills are available but may increase bundle size.

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
export default {
  output: {
    polyfill: 'entry',
  },
};
```

:::tip
It should be noted that when you bundle page with Web Workers, the `entry` mode is not applicable to Web Workers because the Web Workers thread is isolated from the main thread (page), and the `usage` mode can be used at this time.
:::

### off

With `output.polyfill` set to `'off'`, Rsbuild doesn't inject polyfills. You need to handle code compatibility yourself.

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
export default {
  output: {
    polyfill: 'off',
  },
};
```
