# output.polyfill

- **Type:** `'entry' | 'usage' | 'off'`
- **Default:** `'off'`

Control the injection mode of the polyfills.

> Please refer to the [Polyfill Mode](/guide/advanced/browser-compatibility#polyfill-mode) for more details.

## Optional value

### usage

When `output.polyfill` is configured as `'usage'`, Rsbuild will inject the polyfills based on the APIs used in each file. This provides optimal bundle size as only needed polyfills are included.

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
export default {
  output: {
    polyfill: 'usage',
  },
};
```

### entry

When `output.polyfill` is configured as `'entry'`, Rsbuild will inject the polyfills in each entry file. This ensures all polyfills are available but may increase bundle size.

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
export default {
  output: {
    polyfill: 'entry',
  },
};
```

### off

When `output.polyfill` is configured as `'off'`, Rsbuild will not inject the polyfills, and developers need to ensure code compatibility themselves.

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
export default {
  output: {
    polyfill: 'off',
  },
};
```
