# output.sourceMap

- **Type:**

```ts
type SourceMap =
  | boolean
  | {
      js?: Rspack.Configuration['devtool'];
      css?: boolean;
    };
```

- **Default:**

```ts
const defaultSourceMap = {
  js: mode === 'development' ? 'cheap-module-source-map' : false,
  css: false,
};
```

Configure whether to generate source map files and which source map format to generate.

:::tip What is a source map
Source map is an information file that stores the source code mapping relationship. It records each location of the compiled code and the corresponding pre-compilation location. With source map, you can directly view the source code when debugging compiled code.
:::

## Default behavior

By default, Rsbuild generates source maps using these rules:

- In development mode, source maps for JS files are generated for development debugging, while source maps for CSS files are not generated.
- In production mode, no source maps for JS and CSS files are generated to improve build performance.

## Boolean value

If `output.sourceMap` is `true`, the source map will be generated according to the [mode](/config/mode), equivalent to:

```js
export default {
  output: {
    sourceMap: {
      js: mode === 'development' ? 'cheap-module-source-map' : 'source-map',
      css: true,
    },
  },
};
```

If `output.sourceMap` is `false`, no source map will be generated, equivalent to:

```js
export default {
  output: {
    sourceMap: {
      js: false,
      css: false,
    },
  },
};
```

## JS source map

The source map for JS files is controlled by `sourceMap.js` and can be configured by passing in all the source map formats supported by Rspack's [devtool](https://rspack.rs/config/devtool) option. Setting it to `false` will disable the source map.

For example, to generate high-quality source maps in all environments:

```js
export default {
  output: {
    sourceMap: {
      js: 'source-map',
    },
  },
};
```

You can also set different source map formats based on the environment.

```js
export default {
  output: {
    sourceMap: {
      js:
        process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
          ? // Use a high quality source map format for production
            'source-map'
          : // Use a more performant source map format for development
            'cheap-module-source-map',
    },
  },
};
```

:::warning
Do not deploy source maps (`.map` files) to the public web server or CDN when using values such as `source-map` or `hidden-source-map` in production builds. Public source maps will expose your source code and may bring security risks.
:::

## CSS source map

The source map for CSS files is controlled by `sourceMap.css`. Setting it to `true` will enable the source map, while setting it to `false` will disable it.

To generate a source map for CSS files:

```js
export default {
  output: {
    sourceMap: {
      css: true,
    },
  },
};
```

In production builds, it is not recommended to enable both [output.injectStyles](/config/output/inject-styles) and `output.sourceMap.css`, as `output.injectStyles` will inject the source map into the JS bundles, which will increase the file size and slow down the page loading speed.

You can only enable the CSS file source map in development mode:

```js
export default {
  output: {
    injectStyles: true,
    sourceMap: {
      css: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
    },
  },
};
```
