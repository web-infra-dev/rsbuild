# source.assetsInclude

- **Type:** [Rspack.RuleSetCondition](https://rspack.rs/config/module#condition)
- **Default:** `undefined`
- **Version:** `>= 1.0.18`

Include additional files that should be treated as static assets.

By default, Rsbuild treats common image, font, audio, and video files as static assets. Through the `source.assetsInclude` config, you can specify additional file types that should be treated as static assets. These added static assets are processed using the same rules as the built-in supported static assets, see [Static Assets](/guide/basic/static-assets).

The value of `source.assetsInclude` is the same as the `test` option in Rspack loader. It can be a regular expression, string, array, logical condition, etc. For more details, see [Rspack RuleSetCondition](https://rspack.rs/config/module#condition).

## Example

- Treating `.json5` files as static assets:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  source: {
    assetsInclude: /\.json5$/,
  },
});
```

- Treating multiple file types as static assets:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  source: {
    assetsInclude: [/\.json5$/, /\.pdf$/],
  },
});
```

- Treating specific files as static assets:

```ts
import path from 'node:path';

export default defineConfig({
  source: {
    assetsInclude: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/assets/foo.json5'),
  },
});
```
