# source.exclude

- **Type:** [Rspack.RuleSetCondition](https://rspack.rs/config/module-rules#condition)
- **Default:** `[]`

Exclude JavaScript or TypeScript files that do not need to be compiled by [SWC](/guide/configuration/swc).

## Usage

The usage of `source.exclude` is similar to [source.include](/config/source/include), supporting passing in strings or regular expressions to match the module path.

For example:

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
import path from 'node:path';

export default {
  source: {
    exclude: [path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/module-a'), /src\/module-b/],
  },
};
```

> See [source.include](/config/source/include) to learn more usages.

## Priority

When both `source.include` and `source.exclude` are set, `source.exclude` has higher priority.

For example, in the following example, although `source.include` matches the entire `src` directory, JavaScript files in the `src/foo` directory will not be compiled by SWC:

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
import path from 'node:path';

export default {
  source: {
    include: [path.resolve(__dirname, 'src')],
    exclude: [path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/foo')],
  },
};
```

## Exclude from bundling

`source.exclude` specifies JavaScript/TypeScript files that do not need to be compiled. These files will not be transformed by SWC, but referenced files will still be bundled into the outputs.

If you want certain files to be excluded and not bundled into the outputs, you can use Rspack's [IgnorePlugin](https://rspack.rs/plugins/webpack/ignore-plugin).

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
export default {
  tools: {
    rspack: (config, { rspack }) => {
      config.plugins.push(
        new rspack.IgnorePlugin({
          resourceRegExp: /^\.\/locale$/,
          contextRegExp: /moment$/,
        }),
      );
      return config;
    },
  },
};
```
