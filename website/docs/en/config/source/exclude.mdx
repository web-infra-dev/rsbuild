# source.exclude

- **Type:** [Rspack.RuleSetCondition](https://rspack.dev/config/module#condition)
- **Default:** `[]`

Exclude JavaScript or TypeScript files that do not need to be compiled by [SWC](/guide/basic/configure-swc).

## Usage

The usage of `source.exclude` is consistent with [Rule.exclude](https://rspack.dev/config/module#ruleexclude) in Rspack, which supports passing in strings or regular expressions to match the module path.

For example:

```js title="rsbuild.config.ts"
import path from 'node:path';

export default {
  source: {
    exclude: [path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/module-a'), /src\/module-b/],
  },
};
```

> Refer to [source.include](/config/source/include) to learn more.

## Exclude from bundling

`source.exclude` is used to specify JavaScript/TypeScript files that do not need to be compiled. This means that these files will not be translated by SWC, but the referenced files will still be bundled into the outputs.

If you want certain files to be excluded and not bundled into the outputs, you can use Rspack's [IgnorePlugin](https://rspack.dev/plugins/webpack/ignore-plugin).

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
export default {
  tools: {
    rspack: (config, { rspack }) => {
      config.plugins?.push(
        new rspack.IgnorePlugin({
          resourceRegExp: /^\.\/locale$/,
          contextRegExp: /moment$/,
        }),
      );
      return config;
    },
  },
};
```
