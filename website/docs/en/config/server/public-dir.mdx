# server.publicDir

- **Type:**

```ts
type PublicDirOptions = {
  name?: string;
  copyOnBuild?: boolean;
  watch?: boolean;
};
type PublicDir = false | PublicDirOptions | PublicDirOptions[];
```

- **Default:**

```js
const defaultValue = {
  name: 'public',
  copyOnBuild: true,
};
```

By default, Rsbuild will use the `public` directory as the directory for serving public assets, files in this directory will be served at [server.base](/config/server/base) path (default `/`).

## Options

### name

- **Type:** `string`
- **Default:** `'public'`

The name of the public directory. The value of `name` can be set to a relative path or an absolute path. Relative path will be resolved relative to the project root directory.

- Relative path example:

```ts
export default {
  server: {
    publicDir: {
      name: '../some-public',
    },
  },
};
```

- Absolute path example:

```ts
import path from 'node:path';

export default {
  server: {
    publicDir: {
      name: path.join(__dirname, '../some-public'),
    },
  },
};
```

### copyOnBuild

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `true`

Whether to copy files from the publicDir to the distDir on production build.

For example, disable `copyOnBuild`:

```ts
export default {
  server: {
    publicDir: {
      copyOnBuild: false,
    },
  },
};
```

Note that setting the value of `copyOnBuild` to false means that when you run `rsbuild preview` for a production preview, you will not be able to access the corresponding static resources.

:::tip
During dev builds, if you need to copy some static assets to the output directory, you can use the [output.copy](/config/output/copy) option instead.

#### Multiple environments

When performing [multi-environment builds](/guide/advanced/environments), Rsbuild copies files from the public directory to the output directory of each environment. If there are nested output directories, files will only be copied to the root of the output directory. For example:

- The distDir of the `web` environment is `dist`, and the distDir of the `web1` environment is `dist/web1`. Due to the nested relationship between `dist` and `dist/web1`, at this time, the public directory files are only copied to the `dist` directory.
- The distDir of the `esm` environment is `dist/esm`, and the distDir of the `cjs` environment is `dist/cjs`. Since there is no nesting relationship between `dist/esm` and `dist/cjs`, at this time, the public directory files will be copied to the `dist/esm` and `dist/cjs` directories respectively.

### watch

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `false`

Whether to watch the public directory and reload the page when the files change.

Setting `watch` to `true` allows the dev server to watch changes to files in the specified public directory and reload the page when the files are changed:

```ts
export default {
  server: {
    publicDir: {
      watch: true,
    },
  },
};
```

Note that the `watch` option is only valid in development mode. If [dev.hmr](/config/dev/hmr) and [dev.liveReload](/config/dev/live-reload) are both set to false, `watch` will be ignored.

## Multiple Directories

The `server.publicDir` can be configured as an array, allowing you to serve multiple directories as static assets folders:

```ts
export default {
  server: {
    publicDir: [
      {
        name: 'public',
      },
      {
        name: 'assets',
        watch: false,
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

## Disabled

You can set `publicDir` to `false` to disable the static assets serving:

```ts
export default {
  server: {
    publicDir: false,
  },
};
```
