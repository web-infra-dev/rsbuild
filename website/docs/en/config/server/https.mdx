# server.https

- **Type:**

```ts
import type { ServerOptions } from 'node:https';
import type { SecureServerSessionOptions } from 'node:http2';

type Https = ServerOptions | SecureServerSessionOptions;
```

- **Default:** `undefined`

Configure HTTPS options to enable HTTPS server. When enabled, HTTP server will be disabled.

HTTP:

```
  ➜ Local: http://localhost:3000/
  ➜ Network: http://192.168.0.1:3000/
```

HTTPS:

```
  ➜ Local: https://localhost:3000/
  ➜ Network: https://192.168.0.1:3000/
```

:::tip
When HTTPS is enabled, Rsbuild uses an HTTP/2 server by default. However, if you enable [server.proxy](/config/server/proxy), the dev server falls back to HTTP/1 because its underlying dependency, [http-proxy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-proxy), does not support HTTP/2.

## Set certificate

You can manually pass in the certificate and the private key required in the `server.https` option. This parameter will be directly passed to the `createServer` method of the https module in Node.js.

For details, please refer to [https.createServer](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html#https_https_createserver_options_requestlistener).

```ts
import fs from 'node:fs';

export default {
  server: {
    https: {
      key: fs.readFileSync('certificates/private.pem'),
      cert: fs.readFileSync('certificates/public.pem'),
    },
  },
};
```

:::tip
The certificates used for local development are typically generated using [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert). Please read ["How to use HTTPS for local development"](https://web.dev/articles/how-to-use-local-https?hl=en) to learn how to use it.

## Self-signed Certificate

For basic configuration requirements, you can add the [@rsbuild/plugin-basic-ssl](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/rsbuild-plugin-basic-ssl) plugin, which will automatically create a self-signed certificate and set `server.https` option by default.

```ts
import { pluginBasicSsl } from '@rsbuild/plugin-basic-ssl';

export default {
  plugins: [pluginBasicSsl()],
};
```
