# server.https

- **Type:** `import('https').ServerOptions`
- **Default:** `undefined`

After configuring this option, you can enable HTTPS Server, and disabling the HTTP Server.

HTTP:

```bash
  > Local: http://localhost:3000/
  > Network: http://192.168.0.1:3000/
```

HTTPS:

```bash
  > Local: https://localhost:3000/
  > Network: https://192.168.0.1:3000/
```

## Set Certificate

You can manually pass in the certificate and the private key required in the `server.https` option. This parameter will be directly passed to the `createServer` method of the https module in Node.js.

For details, please refer to [https.createServer](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html#https_https_createserver_options_requestlistener).

```ts
import fs from 'node:fs';

export default {
  server: {
    https: {
      key: fs.readFileSync('certificates/private.pem'),
      cert: fs.readFileSync('certificates/public.pem'),
    },
  },
};
```

For basic usage configuration needs, you can add @rsbuild/plugin-basic-ssl to your project plugins, and it will automatically create and cache a self-signed certificate while also enabling HTTPS configuration by default.

```ts
import fs from 'node:fs';
import { pluginBasicSsl } from '@rsbuild/plugin-basic-ssl';

export default {
  plugins: [pluginBasicSsl()],
};
```

The certificates used for local development are typically generated using [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert). Please read ["How to use HTTPS for local development"](https://web.dev/articles/how-to-use-local-https?hl=en) to learn how to use it.
