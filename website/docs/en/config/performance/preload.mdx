# performance.preload

- **Type:** `undefined | true | PreloadOption`

```ts
type IncludeType = 'async-chunks' | 'initial' | 'all-assets' | 'all-chunks';

type Filter = Array<string | RegExp> | ((filename: string) => boolean);

interface PreloadOption {
  type?: IncludeType;
  include?: Filter;
  exclude?: Filter;
}
```

- **Default:** `undefined`

Configure the [`<link rel="preload">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/preload) tag for the static assets generated by Rsbuild.

## What is preload

The preload value of the `<link>` element's rel attribute lets you declare fetch requests in the HTML's `<head>`, specifying resources that your page will need very soon, which you want to start loading early in the page lifecycle, before browsers' main rendering machinery kicks in.

This ensures they are available earlier and are less likely to block the page's render, improving performance. Even though the name contains the term load, it doesn't load and execute the script but only schedules it to be downloaded and cached with a higher priority.

## Boolean Type

When setting `performance.preload` to `true`, Rsbuild will preload resources according to the following configuration:

```js
{
  type: 'async-chunks',
}
```

## Object Type

When the value of `performance.preload` is `object` type, the Rsbuild will enable the preload capability for the specified resource according to the current configuration.

### preload.type

The `type` field controls which resources will be pre-fetched, and supports secondary filtering of specified resources through `include` and `exclude`.

Currently supported resource types are as follows:

- `async-chunks`: preload all asynchronous resources (on the current page), including asynchronous js and its associated css, image, font and other resources.
- `initial`: preload all non-async resources (on the current page). It should be noted that if the current script has been added to the html template, no additional pre-fetching will be performed.
- `all-chunks`: preload all resources (on the current page), including all asynchronous and non-asynchronous resources.
- `all-assets`: preload all resources, and resources of other pages will be included in the MPA scenario.

### Example

When you want to preload all image resources in png format on the current page, you can configure it as follows:

```js
export default {
  performance: {
    preload: {
      type: 'all-chunks',
      include: [/.*\.png$/],
    },
  },
};
```
