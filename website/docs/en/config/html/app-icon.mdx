type AppIcon = {
  name?: string;
  icons: AppIconItem[];
};
```

- **Default:** `undefined`

## Example

For display on different devices, you will need to prepare several icons of different sizes.

The most commonly used icon sizes are `192x192` and `512x512`, and you can customize the icon sizes and quantities to suit your needs.

```js
export default {
  html: {
    appIcon: {
      name: 'My Website',
      icons: [
        { src: './src/assets/logo-192.png', size: 192 },
        { src: './src/assets/logo-512.png', size: 512 },
      ],
    },
  },
};
```

After compilation, the following tags will be automatically generated in the HTML:

```html
<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.webmanifest" />
<link
  rel="apple-touch-icon"
  sizes="180x180"
  href="/static/image/logo-192.png"
/>
```

Here, `manifest.webmanifest` is a JSON file that contains information about the application's name, icons, and other details.

```json
{
  "name": "My Website",
  "icons": [
    { "src": "/static/image/logo-192.png", "sizes": "192x192" },
    { "src": "/static/image/logo-512.png", "sizes": "512x512" }
  ]
}
```

## Name

- **Type:** `string`
- **Default value:** `undefined`

The name of the application that will be displayed when it is added to the home screen of the mobile device. If not set, the `manifest.webmanifest` file will not be generated.

> For more details, see [Web app manifests - name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/name).

## Icons

- **Type:** `AppIconItem[]`
- **Default value:** `undefined`

The list of icons:

- `src` is the path to the icon, which can be a relative or absolute path.
- `size` is the size of the icon in pixels. By default, the manifest file will include all icons, while the `apple-touch-icon` tag will only include icons smaller than `200x200`.

`src` can be set to an absolute path:

```js
import path from 'node:path';

export default {
  html: {
    appIcon: {
      name: 'My Website',
      icons: [
        { src: path.resolve(__dirname, './assets/icon-192.png'), size: 192 },
        { src: path.resolve(__dirname, './assets/icon-512.png'), size: 512 },
      ],
    },
  },
};
```
