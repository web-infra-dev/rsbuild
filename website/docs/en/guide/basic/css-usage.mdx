# Import CSS Files

Rsbuild provides out-of-the-box support for CSS, including PostCSS, CSS Modules, CSS preprocessors, CSS inlining, and CSS compression.

Rsbuild also provides several configurations that allow customization of the processing rules for CSS files.

## Lightning CSS

:::tip
[Lightning CSS](https://lightningcss.dev) is a high performance CSS parser, transformer and minifier written in Rust. It supports parsing and transforming many modern CSS features into syntax supported by target browsers, and also provides a better compression ratio.
:::

Rsbuild uses Rspack's built-in [lightningcss-loader](https://www.rspack.dev/guide/features/builtin-lightningcss-loader) to transform CSS code. It automatically reads the project's [browserslist](/guide/advanced/browserslist) config and converts the CSS code to syntax supported by target browsers.

- Lightning CSS automatically adds vendor prefixes like `-webkit-`, `-moz-`, `-ms-`, etc., so you don't need to manually add prefixes or use the [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) plugin.
- Lightning CSS automatically downgrades CSS syntax, allowing you to use modern CSS features such as CSS nesting and custom media queries in your code without worrying about browser compatibility issues.
- You can use [tools.lightningcssLoader](/config/tools/lightningcss-loader) to customize the options for `lightningcss-loader`.
- If Lightning CSS does not meet your needs, you can also use [PostCSS](#using-postcss) to transform CSS code.

> Rsbuild has enabled Lightning CSS by default since version `1.0.1-beta.6`.

## CSS Minification

When building for production, Rsbuild enables Rspack's built-in [LightningCssMinimizerRspackPlugin](https://rspack.dev/plugins/rspack/lightning-css-minimizer-rspack-plugin) plugin to minify CSS assets for better transmission efficiency.

- You can disable CSS minification through the [output.minify](/config/output/minify) option or customize the options for `LightningCssMinimizerRspackPlugin`.
- You can use [@rsbuild/plugin-css-minimizer](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/rsbuild-plugin-css-minimizer) to customize the CSS minimizer, switching to [cssnano](https://github.com/cssnano/cssnano) or other CSS minimizer.

## Using PostCSS

Rsbuild supports transforming CSS code through [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/). You can configure PostCSS in the following ways:

1. Rsbuild uses [postcss-load-config](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-load-config) to load the PostCSS configuration file in the root directory of the current project, such as `postcss.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  'postcss-px-to-viewport': {
    viewportWidth: 375,
  },
};
```

2. Configure the postcss-loader through Rsbuild's [tools.postcss](/config/tools/postcss) option, which supports modifying the built-in configuration through a function, for example:

```ts
export default {
  tools: {
    postcss: (opts) => {
      const viewportPlugin = require('postcss-px-to-viewport')({
        viewportWidth: 375,
      });
      opts.postcssOptions.plugins.push(viewportPlugin);
    },
  },
};
```

- When you configure both the `postcss.config.js` file and the `tools.postcss` option, both will take effect, and the `tools.postcss` option will take precedence.
- If there is no `postcss.config.js` file in the project and the `tools.postcss` option is not configured, Rsbuild will not register `postcss-loader`.

## Using CSS Modules

Rsbuild supports CSS Modules by default, please read the [Using CSS Modules](/guide/basic/css-modules) chapter for the complete usage of CSS Modules.

## Using CSS preprocessors

Rsbuild supports popular CSS preprocessors through plugins, including Sass, Less and Stylus. See how to use them:

- [Sass Plugin](/plugins/list/plugin-sass)
- [Less Plugin](/plugins/list/plugin-less)
- [Stylus Plugin](/plugins/list/plugin-stylus)

## CSS-in-JS

Please read the [React - CSS-in-JS](/guide/framework/react#css-in-js) section to learn how to use common CSS-in-JS libraries in Rsbuild.

## Inline CSS Files

By default, Rsbuild will extract CSS into a separate `.css` file and output it to the dist directory.

If you want to inline styles into your JS file, you can set [output.injectStyles](/config/output/inject-styles) to true to disable CSS extraction logic. When the JS file is requested by the browser, JS dynamically inserts the `<style>` tag into the Html to load the CSS styles.

```ts
export default {
  output: {
    injectStyles: true,
  },
};
```

This will increase the size of your JS Bundle, so it is usually not recommended to disable the CSS extraction.

## Import CSS in node_modules

You can directly import CSS files in node_modules.

- Import in a component:

```ts title="src/App.tsx"
// Import the Arco Design style:
import '@arco-design/web-react/dist/css/arco.css';
```

- Import in a style file:

```css title="src/App.css"
/* reference normalize.css */
/* https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css */
@import 'normalize.css';

body {
  /* */
}
```
