# Import CSS Files

Rsbuild provides out-of-the-box support for CSS, including PostCSS, CSS Modules, CSS preprocessors, CSS inlining, and CSS compression.

In addition, Rsbuild also provides multiple configs to customize the compile rules of style resources.

## Using PostCSS

Rsbuild has built-in [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) to transform the CSS code. You can configure PostCSS in the following ways:

1. Rsbuild uses [postcss-load-config](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-load-config) to load the PostCSS configuration file in the root directory of the current project, such as `postcss.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  'postcss-px-to-viewport': {
    viewportWidth: 375,
  },
};
```

2. Configure the postcss-loader through Rsbuild's [tools.postcss](/config/tools/postcss) option, which supports modifying the built-in configuration through a function, for example:

```ts
export default {
  tools: {
    postcss: (opts) => {
      const viewportPlugin = require('postcss-px-to-viewport')({
        viewportWidth: 375,
      });
      opts.postcssOptions.plugins.push(viewportPlugin);
    },
  },
};
```

When you configure both the `postcss.config.js` file and the `tools.postcss` option, both will take effect, and the `tools.postcss` option will take precedence.

## Using CSS Modules

Rsbuild supports CSS Modules by default, please read the [Using CSS Modules](/guide/basic/css-modules) chapter for the complete usage of CSS Modules.

## Using CSS preprocessors

Rsbuild supports popular CSS preprocessors through plugins, including Sass, Less and Stylus. See how to use them:

- [Sass Plugin](/plugins/list/plugin-sass)
- [Less Plugin](/plugins/list/plugin-less)
- [Stylus Plugin](/plugins/list/plugin-stylus)

## CSS-in-JS

Please read the [React - CSS-in-JS](/guide/framework/react#css-in-js) section to learn how to use common CSS-in-JS libraries in Rsbuild.

## CSS Minify

During the production build, Rsbuild compresses static assets such as CSS and JS to provide better transmission efficiency.

Rsbuild by default uses the built-in `LightningCssMinimizerRspackPlugin` plugin from Rspack to automatically compress CSS code during production builds.

You can customize the CSS minimizer by using the [@rsbuild/plugin-css-minimizer](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/rsbuild-plugin-css-minimizer) to switch to cssnano or other tools for CSS compression.

## Inline CSS Files

By default, Rsbuild will extract CSS into a separate `.css` file and output it to the dist directory.

If you want to inline styles into your JS file, you can set [output.injectStyles](/config/output/inject-styles) to true to disable CSS extraction logic. When the JS file is requested by the browser, JS dynamically inserts the `<style>` tag into the Html to load the CSS styles.

```ts
export default {
  output: {
    injectStyles: true,
  },
};
```

This will increase the size of your JS Bundle, so it is usually not recommended to disable the CSS extraction.

## Import CSS in node_modules

You can directly import CSS files in node_modules.

- Import in a component:

```ts title="src/App.tsx"
// Import the Arco Design style:
import '@arco-design/web-react/dist/css/arco.css';
```

- Import in a style file:

```css title="src/App.css"
/* reference normalize.css */
/* https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css */
@import 'normalize.css';

body {
  /* */
}
```
