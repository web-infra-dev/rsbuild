# Upgrade Rsbuild

This section explains how to upgrade the project's Rsbuild dependencies to the latest version.

> Please see [Releases](/community/releases/index) to understand the Rsbuild release strategy.

## Using Taze

We recommend using [Taze](https://github.com/antfu-collective/taze) to upgrade the Rsbuild version. Taze is a CLI tool for updating npm dependencies.

### Usage

Run the following command to upgrade all dependencies that include `rsbuild` in their names:

```bash
npx taze --include /rsbuild/ -w
```

The result will look similar to:

```bash
rsbuild - 3 patch

  @rsbuild/core               dev  ~2mo  ^0.6.0  →  ^0.6.15
  @rsbuild/plugin-react       dev  ~2mo  ^0.6.0  →  ^0.6.15
  @rsbuild/plugin-type-check  dev  ~2mo  ^0.6.0  →  ^0.6.15

ℹ changes written to package.json, run npm i to install updates.
```

You can also adjust the `include` pattern to match specific packages, for example, to upgrade only packages under the `@rsbuild` scope:

```bash
npx taze --include /@rsbuild/ -w
```

### Options

Here are some examples of using taze options.

- In a monorepo, you can add the `-r` option to upgrade recursively:

```bash
npx taze --include /rsbuild/ -w -r
```

- Add `-l` to upgrade locked versions:

```bash
npx taze --include /rsbuild/ -w -l
```

- To upgrade to a major version:

```bash
npx taze major --include /rsbuild/ -w
```
