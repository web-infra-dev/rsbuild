# Configure SWC

[SWC](https://github.com/swc-project/swc) (Speedy Web Compiler) is a transformer and minimizer for JavaScript and TypeScript based on Rust. SWC provides similar functionality to Babel and Terser, and it is 20x faster than Babel on a single thread and 70x faster on four cores.

Rsbuild enables the following SWC features by default:

- Transform JavaScript and TypeScript code using Rspack's [builtin:swc-loader](https://rspack.dev/guide/features/builtin-swc-loader), which is the Rust version of [swc-loader](https://github.com/swc-project/pkgs/tree/main/packages/swc-loader).
- Minify JavaScript code using Rspack's [SwcJsMinimizerRspackPlugin](https://rspack.dev/plugins/rspack/swc-js-minimizer-rspack-plugin).

## Loader Options

The options for `builtin:swc-loader` are consistent with the JS version of swc-loader. Rsbuild provides the [tools.swc](/config/tools/swc) option to configure `builtin:swc-loader`. Here are some examples:

### Register SWC Plugin

`tools.swc` can be used to register SWC's Wasm plugins, for example, registering [@swc/plugin-styled-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swc/plugin-styled-components):

```js
export default {
  tools: {
    swc: {
      jsc: {
        experimental: {
          plugins: [['@swc/plugin-styled-components', {}]],
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

> You can check out the [awesome-swc](https://github.com/swc-contrib/awesome-swc) repository to see the SWC plugins available in the community.

### SWC Plugin Version

Please note that the SWC plugin is still an experimental feature, and the SWC Wasm plugin is currently not backward compatible. The version of the SWC plugin is closely tied to the version of `swc_core` that Rspack depends on.

This means that you must to choose an SWC plugin that matches the current version of `swc_core` to ensure that it works properly. If the version of the SWC plugin you are using does not match the version of `swc_core` that Rspack depends on, Rspack will throw the following error during the build process:

```text
1: failed to run Wasm plugin transform. Please ensure the version of `swc_core`
   used by the plugin is compatible with the host runtime.
```

If you encounter the above issue, a common solution is to upgrade both the Rsbuild and the SWC plugin to the latest versions. If this does not solve the problem, you can refer to [SWC - Selecting the version](https://swc.rs/docs/plugin/selecting-swc-core) to understand the version information of `swc_core`.

You can check the version information of `swc_core` in the Cargo.toml file within the Rust code repository. For example, in the Rspack repository, you can open [Cargo.toml](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspack/blob/main/Cargo.toml) and search for the `swc_core` keyword to view the version.

### Enable Emotion Support

Example of enabling the Emotion support using the `builtin:swc-loader`:

```js
export default {
  tools: {
    swc: {
      jsc: {
        experimental: {
          plugins: [['@swc/plugin-emotion', {}]],
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

For more options, please refer to [@swc/plugin-emotion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swc/plugin-emotion).

### Enable Relay Support

Example of enabling the Relay support using the `builtin:swc-loader`:

```js
export default {
  tools: {
    swc: {
      jsc: {
        experimental: {
          plugins: [['@swc/plugin-relay', {}]],
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

For more options, please refer to [@swc/plugin-relay](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swc/plugin-relay).

## Minimizer Options

Rsbuild provides the [output.minify.js](/config/output/minify) option to configure the SwcJsMinimizerRspackPlugin. Here are some examples:

### Exclude Files

You can exclude certain files from being minified using the `exclude` option:

```ts
export default {
  output: {
    minify: {
      jsOptions: {
        exclude: /foo\/bar/,
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## Switching Minimizer

If the `SwcJsMinimizerRspackPlugin` does not meet your needs, you can switch to other minimizers through the [tools.bundlerChain](/config/tools/bundler-chain) option.

For example, to switch to [Terser](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin) for minifying JavaScript, which is more stable but performs worse compared to SWC:

```ts
export default {
  tools: {
    bundlerChain(chain, { CHAIN_ID, isProd }) {
      if (isProd) {
        chain.optimization.minimizer(CHAIN_ID.MINIMIZER.JS).use(TerserPlugin, [
          {
            minify: TerserPlugin.terserMinify,
          },
        ]);
      }
    },
  },
};
```
