# Configure SWC

[SWC](https://github.com/swc-project/swc) (Speedy Web Compiler) is a transformer and minimizer for JavaScript and TypeScript based on Rust. SWC provides similar functionality to Babel and Terser, and it is 20x faster than Babel on a single thread and 70x faster on four cores.

Rsbuild uses Rspack's [builtin:swc-loader](https://rspack.dev/guide/features/builtin-swc-loader) by default to transform JavaScript and TypeScript code. It is the Rust version of [swc-loader](https://github.com/swc-project/pkgs/tree/main/packages/swc-loader), and its options align with the JS version of swc-loader.

## Configure swc-loader

Rsbuild provides the [tools.swc](/config/tools/swc) option to configure `builtin:swc-loader`. Here are some examples:

### Register SWC Plugin

`tools.swc` can be used to register SWC's Wasm plugins, for example, registering `@swc/plugin-styled-jsx`:

```js
export default {
  tools: {
    swc: {
      jsc: {
        experimental: {
          plugins: [['@swc/plugin-styled-jsx', {}]],
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

Please note that SWC's wasm plugins are currently not backward compatible, and there is a certain binding relationship between the SWC plugin and the version of `@swc/core` that Rspack depends on. Therefore, you must select the SWC plugin that matches the current version of `@swc/core` for SWC to work.

For more information, refer to [SWC - Selecting the version](https://swc.rs/docs/plugin/selecting-swc-core).

> You can check out the [awesome-swc](https://github.com/swc-contrib/awesome-swc) repository to see the SWC plugins available in the community.

### Enable Emotion Support

Example of enabling the Emotion support using the `builtin:swc-loader`:

```js
export default {
  tools: {
    swc: {
      jsc: {
        experimental: {
          plugins: [['@swc/plugin-emotion', {}]],
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

For more options, please refer to [@swc/plugin-emotion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swc/plugin-emotion).

### Enable Relay Support

Example of enabling the Relay support using the `builtin:swc-loader`:

```js
export default {
  tools: {
    swc: {
      jsc: {
        experimental: {
          plugins: [['@swc/plugin-relay', {}]],
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```
