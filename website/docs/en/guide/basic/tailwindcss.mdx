# Use Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a CSS framework and design system based on utility class, which can quickly add common styles to components, and support flexible extension of theme styles.

You can integrate Tailwind CSS in Rsbuild via PostCSS plugins.

## Installing Tailwind CSS

Since Rsbuild has built-in support for `postcss` and `autoprefixer`, you only need to install `tailwindcss` and there is no need to install other npm packages:

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

<PackageManagerTabs command="add tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss -D" />

## Configuring PostCSS

You can register the `tailwindcss` PostCSS plugin through [postcss.config.cjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-loader#config) or [tools.postcss](/config/tools/postcss).

```js title="postcss.config.mjs"
export default {
  plugins: {
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": {},
  }
}
```

:::tip
Rsbuild has built-in [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer), so you only need to register the `tailwindcss` plugin.

## Importing CSS

Add the `@tailwind` directives in your CSS entry file:

```css title="main.css"
@tailwind tailwindcss;
```

Depending on your needs, you can selectively import the CSS styles provided by Tailwind CSS. Please refer to the [@tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#tailwind) for detailed usage of the `@tailwind` directives.

## Done

You have now completed all the steps to integrate Tailwind CSS in Rsbuild!

You can use Tailwind's utility classes in any component or HTML, such as:

```html
<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold underline">Hello world!</h1>
```

For more usage details, refer to the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## VS Code extension

Tailwind CSS provides a [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-intellisense) plugin for VS Code to automatically complete Tailwind CSS class names, CSS functions, and directives.

You can install this plugin in VS Code to enable the autocompletion feature.
