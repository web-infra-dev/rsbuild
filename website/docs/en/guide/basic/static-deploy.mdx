# Deploy Static Site

This section introduces how to deploy the build outputs of Rsbuild as a static site.

## Background Information

Before starting the deployment, you need to understand some background information:

- The CLI commands used for building and previewing outputs.
- The directory structure of the build outputs.
- The URL prefix of static assets.

### Build Commands

The build commands provided by Rsbuild:

- [build command](/guide/basic/cli#rsbuild-build), used to generate the build outputs for production deployment.
- [preview command](/guide/basic/cli#rsbuild-preview), used to preview the production build outputs locally. Note that you need to execute the `rsbuild build` command beforehand to generate the build outputs.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "rsbuild build",
    "preview": "rsbuild preview"
  }
}
```

:::tip
The preview command is only used for local preview. Do not use it for production servers, as it is not designed for that.

### Output Directory

Rsbuild's build outputs typically includes HTML, JS, CSS, and other assets, and is output to the `dist` directory by default. The name and structure of the dist directory can be changed using some configuration options. See the [Output Files](/guide/basic/output-files) section for more information.

```bash
dist
├── static
│   ├── image
│   ├── css
│   └── js
└── [name].html
```

### Asset Prefix

We can divide the build output into two parts: **HTML files** and **static assets**.

- HTML files refer to files with the `.html` suffix in the output directory, which usually need to be deployed on the server.
- Static assets are located in the `static` directory of the output folder, which contains assets such as JavaScript, CSS, and images. They can be deployed either on the server or on a CDN.

If the static assets are deployed in a subdirectory of the server, you can configure [output.assetPrefix](/config/output/asset-prefix) as the base path:

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@rsbuild/core';

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    assetPrefix: '/some-base-folder/',
  },
});
```

If you want to place these static assets on a CDN for better performance, rather than directly on the server like HTML, you will need to configure the [output.assetPrefix](/config/output/asset-prefix) to the CDN address to allow the application to properly reference these static assets.

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@rsbuild/core';

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    assetPrefix: 'https://cdn.com/path/',
  },
});
```

In this way, when referencing static assets in HTML, the specified prefix will be automatically added, for example:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.com/path/static/js/index.some-hash.js"></script>
```

## GitHub Pages

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub

The following are step-by-step examples on how to deploy on GitHub Pages.

1. Set the URL prefix for static assets through [output.assetPrefix](/config/output/asset-prefix).

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@rsbuild/core';

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    // Please replace <REPO_NAME> with the repository name.
    // For example, "/my-project/"
    assetPrefix: '/<REPO_NAME>/',
  },
});
```

2. Open the "Settings" page of GitHub repository, click "Pages" from the left menu to access the configuration page of GitHub Pages.
3. Select "Source" -> "GitHub Actions" and click "create your own" to create a GitHub Action config file.
4. Paste the following content into the input box and name the file `github-pages.yml` (you can adjust the content and name of the file as needed).

```yaml title="github-pages.yml"
# Sample workflow for building and deploying a Rsbuild site to GitHub Pages
name: Rsbuild Deployment

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches: ['main']
  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment
concurrency:
  group: 'pages'
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Use Node.js 20
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 20

      # If you use other package managers like yarn or pnpm,
      # you will need to install them first
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm i

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: './dist'

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

5. Commit and wait for GitHub Actions to execute. Once it's done, you can visit `https://<USERNAME>.github.io/<REPO_NAME>/` to view the deployed page.

## Netlify

[Netlify Core](https://www.netlify.com/) is a frontend cloud solution for developers to build and deploy future-proof digital solutions with modern, composable tooling.

### Add New Site

Netlify provides a detailed guide, you can follow the instructions in [Netlify - Add new site](https://docs.netlify.com/welcome/add-new-site/), set up some basic information, and then you can start the deployment.

You need to configure the following two fields:

- **Build command**: fill in the build command of the project, it is typically `npm run build`.
- **Publish directory**: fill in the output directory in the project, the default is `dist`.

Then click on the **Deploy site** button to start the deployment.

### Custom Domains

If you want to make your sites accessible at your own domain names, you can configure it in the "Domain management" section of Netlify.

> Detailed guide: [Netlify - Custom domains](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/).

## Vercel

### Add New Site

Vercel provides a detailed guide that you can follow [Vercel - Projects](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/overview) to create a project in your dashboard and configure some basic information to start deployment.

You only need to configure the fields under "Build and Output Settings":

- **Output directory**: fill in the output directory in the project, the default is `dist`.

Then click the **Deploy** button to start the deployment.

### Configure Domains

If you want to make your sites accessible at your own domain names, you can configure it in the "Domains" section of Vercel.
