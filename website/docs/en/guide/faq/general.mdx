### What is the relationship between Rsbuild and Rspack?

Rspack is the base bundler for Rsbuild. The goal of Rsbuild is to provide out-of-the-box build capabilities for Rspack users, allowing developers to start a web project with zero configuration.

The main differences between Rspack and Rsbuild are:

- Rspack projects need to be configured from scratch, while Rsbuild provides default best practice configurations and supports extending Rspack configurations.
- Rspack projects require integration with loaders and plugins from the community to support different scenarios, while Rsbuild provides official plugins and default support for common frontend frameworks and build capabilities.
- The capabilities of Rspack CLI are comparable to webpack CLI, with relatively streamlined functionality, while Rsbuild provides a more powerful CLI and more complete dev server.

### Can Rsbuild be used to build libraries or UI components?

Rsbuild is designed for building web applications out of the box.

For libraries and UI components, we recommend using [Rslib](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rslib), which is a library development tool based on Rsbuild and can reuse Rsbuild's configuration and plugins.

### What is the relationship between Rsbuild and Modern.js?

Modern.js is a progressive web development framework built on top of Rsbuild. Modern.js's build capabilities are powered by Rsbuild.

The main differences between Modern.js and Rsbuild are:

- Modern.js is based on React, while Rsbuild is not coupled with any frontend UI framework.
- Modern.js is a full-stack solution, providing runtime and server-side capabilities, while Rsbuild is a build tool with other capabilities extendable via plugins.
- Modern.js has more built-in features, while Rsbuild pursues lightweight and flexibility.
