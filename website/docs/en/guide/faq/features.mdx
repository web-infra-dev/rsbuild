### How to import a UI component library on demand?

To enable on-demand imports for a component library, configure [source.transformImport](/config/source/transform-import). This works the same way as [babel-plugin-import](https://npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-import).

```ts
export default {
  source: {
    transformImport: [
      {
        libraryName: 'my-components',
        libraryDirectory: 'es',
        style: true,
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

### How to run ESLint during compilation?

To protect compilation performance, Rsbuild doesn't run ESLint checks during builds by default. If you need ESLint in the pipeline, use the [ESLint plugin](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/rsbuild-plugin-eslint).

### How to configure CDN path for static assets?

To serve static assets like JS and CSS from a CDN, set the asset URL prefix with [output.assetPrefix](/config/output/asset-prefix).

```js
export default {
  output: {
    assetPrefix: 'https://cdn.example.com/assets/',
  },
};
```

### How to remove console after production build?

In production builds, you can strip `console` calls to avoid shipping development logs.

Rsbuild provides a built-in option for removing console statements. See [performance.removeConsole](/config/performance/remove-console).

### How to view the final generated Rspack configuration?

Use Rsbuild's debug mode to view the Rspack configuration that Rsbuild generates.

Enable debug mode by setting the `DEBUG=rsbuild` environment variable when running a build. In this mode, the generated Rspack configuration is written to the `dist` directory.

```bash
➜ DEBUG=rsbuild pnpm dev

  ...
  rsbuild 10:00:00 configuration loaded from: /path/to/...
  rsbuild 10:00:00 registering default plugins
  rsbuild 10:00:00 default plugins registered
  ...

config inspection completed, generated files:

  - Rsbuild config: /root/my-project/dist/.rsbuild/rsbuild.config.mjs
  - Rspack config (web): /root/my-project/dist/.rsbuild/rspack.config.web.mjs
```

### How to ignore specific warnings?

By default, Rsbuild prints all errors and warnings from the build.

If a noisy third-party package produces many warnings, you can silence specific messages with Rspack's `ignoreWarnings` configuration.

```ts
export default {
  tools: {
    rspack: {
      ignoreWarnings: [/Using \/ for division outside of calc()/],
    },
  },
};
```
