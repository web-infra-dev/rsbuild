# Path aliases

Path aliases allow developers to define aliases for modules, making it easier to reference them in code. This can be useful when you want to use a short, easy-to-remember name for a module instead of a long, complex path.

For example, if you frequently reference the `src/common/request.ts` module in your project, you can define an alias for it as `@request` and then use `import request from '@request'` in your code instead of writing the full relative path every time. This also allows you to move the module to a different location without needing to update all the import statements in your code.

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import request from '@request'; // resolve to `src/common/request.ts`
```

In Rsbuild, there are several ways to set up path aliases:

- Use the [`paths` field](#typescript-paths-field) in tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json.
- Use the [`imports` field](#nodejs-imports-field) in package.json.
- Use Rsbuild's [resolve.alias](#alias-configuration) configuration.

## TypeScript `paths` field

You can configure aliases through the `paths` configuration in [tsconfig.json](https://typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html), which is the recommended approach in TypeScript projects as it also resolves the TS type issues related to path aliases.

For example:

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@common/*": ["./src/common/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

After configuring, if you reference `@common/Foo.tsx` in your code, it will be mapped to the `<project>/src/common/Foo.tsx` path.

### jsconfig.json

In non-TypeScript projects, if you need to set path aliases through the `paths` field in [jsconfig.json](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/jsconfig), you can use the [source.tsconfigPath](/config/source/tsconfig-path) option to set it.

After adding the following configuration, Rsbuild will recognize the `paths` field in `jsconfig.json`.

```js title="rsbuild.config.mjs"
export default {
  source: {
    tsconfigPath: './jsconfig.json',
  },
};
```

## Node.js `imports` field

You also use the Node.js [`imports` field](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#imports) to define aliases with the `#` prefix. This works out of the box and does not require additional Rsbuild configuration.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "type": "module",
  "imports": {
    "#app/*": "./src/*"
  }
}
```

```js title="src/index.js"
import { message } from '#app/foo';
```

For TypeScript projects, enable [`resolvePackageJsonImports`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#resolvePackageJsonImports) so the TypeScript language service and compiler can understand these aliases.

## Alias configuration

Rsbuild provides the [resolve.alias](/config/resolve/alias) configuration option, which corresponds to the webpack/Rspack native [resolve.alias](https://rspack.rs/config/resolve#resolvealias) configuration. You can configure this option using an object or a function.

### Use cases

Since the `paths` configuration in `tsconfig.json` is written in a static JSON file, it lacks dynamism.

The `resolve.alias` configuration can address this limitation by allowing you to dynamically set the `resolve.alias` using JavaScript code, such as based on environment variables.

### Object usage

You can configure `resolve.alias` using an object, where the relative paths will be automatically resolved to absolute paths.

For example:

```js
export default {
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@common': './src/common',
    },
  },
};
```

After configuring, if you reference `@common/Foo.tsx` in your code, it will be mapped to the `<project>/src/common/Foo.tsx` path.

### Function usage

You can also configure `resolve.alias` as a function, which receives the built-in `alias` object and allows you to modify it.

For example:

```js
export default {
  resolve: {
    alias: (alias) => {
      alias['@common'] = './src/common';
      return alias;
    },
  },
};
```

### Priority

The `paths` configuration in `tsconfig.json` takes precedence over the `resolve.alias` configuration. When a path matches the rules defined in both `paths` and `resolve.alias`, the value defined in `paths` will be used.

You can adjust the priority of these two options using [resolve.aliasStrategy](/config/resolve/alias-strategy).
