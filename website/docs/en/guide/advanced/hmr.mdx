# Hot module replacement

Hot Module Replacement (HMR) exchanges, adds, or removes modules while an application is running, without a full reload. This can significantly speed up development in a few ways:

- Retain application state which is lost during a full reload.
- Save valuable development time by only updating what's changed.
- Instantly update the browser when modifications are made to CSS / JS in the source code, which is almost comparable to changing styles directly in the browser's dev tools.

## HMR toggle

Rsbuild has built-in support for HMR, which is enabled by default in development mode.

If you don't need HMR, set [dev.hmr](/config/dev/hmr) to `false`. This will disable HMR and React Refresh, and Rsbuild will automatically fall back to [dev.liveReload](/config/dev/live-reload).

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
export default {
  dev: {
    hmr: false,
  },
};
```

To disable both HMR and live reload, set both [dev.hmr](/config/dev/hmr) and [dev.liveReload](/config/dev/live-reload) to `false`. Then, no WebSocket requests will be made to the dev server from the page, and the page will not automatically refresh when files change.

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
export default {
  dev: {
    hmr: false,
    liveReload: false,
  },
};
```

## Specify HMR URL

By default, Rsbuild uses the host and port number of the current page to construct the WebSocket URL for HMR.

When the HMR connection fails, you can specify the WebSocket URL by customizing [dev.client](/config/dev/client) config.

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
export default {
  dev: {
    client: {
      host: 'localhost',
      protocol: 'ws',
    },
  },
};
```

## File watching

By default, Rsbuild does not watch files in the `.git/` and `node_modules/` directories. When files in these directories change, Rsbuild will not trigger a rebuild. This reduces memory usage and improves build performance.

If you want to watch these directories, you can manually configure Rspack's [watchOptions.ignored](https://rspack.rs/config/watch#watchoptionsignored) to override the default behavior.

For example, to watch the `node_modules/` directory and ignore the `.git/` directory, you can configure it as follows:

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
export default {
  tools: {
    rspack: {
      watchOptions: {
        ignored: /\.git/,
      },
    },
  },
};
```
