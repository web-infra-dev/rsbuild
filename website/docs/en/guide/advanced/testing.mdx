# Testing

Rsbuild doesn't include built-in testing frameworks, but integrates seamlessly with popular testing tools.

This guide will introduce how to add [unit testing](#unit-testing) and [end-to-end testing](#end-to-end-testing) to Rsbuild applications.

## Unit testing

Unit tests verify individual components and functions in isolation. Rsbuild can work with testing frameworks like [Rstest](https://rstest.rs), [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), and others.

The following example uses Rstest to demonstrate how to add unit testing to a Rsbuild application.

### Rstest

[Rstest](https://rstest.rs/) is a testing framework built on Rsbuild that provides first-class support for Rsbuild applications. It offers Jest-compatible APIs while natively supporting modern features like TypeScript and ESM.

#### Installing

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

<PackageManagerTabs command="add @rstest/core -D" />

#### Configuring scripts

Add test scripts to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "rstest",
    "test:watch": "rstest -w"
  }
}
```

#### Writing tests

Create test files, for example:

```ts title="src/utils.ts"
export function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b;
}
```

```ts title="src/utils.test.ts"
import { expect, test } from '@rstest/core';
import { add } from './utils';

test('should add two numbers correctly', () => {
  expect(add(1, 2)).toBe(3);
  expect(add(-1, 1)).toBe(0);
});
```

#### Running tests

```bash
# Run tests
npm run test

# Run and watch
npm run test:watch
```

These are the basic steps for using Rstest. Check the [Rstest documentation](https://rstest.rs/guide/start/) for more usage details.

### Examples

Refer to the following examples for more usage patterns:

- [react-rstest](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/rstack-examples/tree/main/rsbuild/react-rstest): Using Rstest and [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) to test React components.
- [react-jest](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/rstack-examples/tree/main/rsbuild/react-jest): Using Jest and [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) to test React components.

## End-to-End testing

End-to-end testing validates complete user workflows, ensuring your application functions correctly in real browser environments.

For E2E testing, we recommend Playwright, a modern end-to-end testing framework. See the [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) for details.
