# Quick Start

## Setup Environment

Before getting started, you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= version 16, it is recommended to use the Node.js LTS version.

Check the current Node.js version with the following command:

```bash
node -v
```

If you do not have Node.js installed in current environment, or the installed version is too low, you can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) to install.

Here is an example of how to install via nvm:

```bash
# Install Node.js LTS
nvm install --lts
# Switch to Node.js LTS
nvm use --lts
```

## Creating an Rsbuild Project

You can use the `create-rsbuild` to create a new Rsbuild project. Just execute the following command:

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

<PackageManagerTabs
  command={{
    npm: 'npm create rsbuild@latest',
    yarn: 'yarn create rsbuild',
    pnpm: 'pnpm create rsbuild@latest',
    bun: 'bun create rsbuild@latest',
  }}
/>

Then follow the prompts to complete the operation. You can choose from the following templates provided by `create-rsbuild`:

| Template | Description                     | Optional Features |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| react    | [React 18](https://react.dev/)  | TypeScript        |
| vue3     | [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/)     | TypeScript        |
| vue2     | [Vue 2](https://v2.vuejs.org/)  | TypeScript        |
| lit      | [Lit](https://lit.dev/)         | TypeScript        |
| preact   | [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) | TypeScript        |
| svelte   | [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)   | TypeScript        |
| solid    | [Solid](https://solidjs.com/)   | TypeScript        |
| vanilla  | Vanilla JavaScript              | TypeScript        |

## Migrate from Existing Projects

If you need to migrate from an existing project to Rsbuild, you can refer to the following guides:

- [Migrate from Webpack](/guide/migration/webpack)
- [Migrate from Create React App](/guide/migration/cra)
- [Migrate from Vue CLI](/guide/migration/vue-cli)
- [Migrate from Modern.js Builder](/guide/migration/modern-builder)

### Other Projects

For other types of projects, you can manually install the [@rsbuild/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rsbuild/core) package:

<PackageManagerTabs command="add @rsbuild/core -D" />

Then refer to the guide and documentation to enable the features you need:

- See [CLI](/guide/basic/cli) to learn about available CLI commands.
- See [Plugin List](/plugins/list/index) to select Rsbuild plugins.
- See [Configure Rsbuild](/guide/basic/configure-rsbuild) to configure Rsbuild.

## Command Line Interface

Rsbuild comes with a lightweight CLI that includes commands such as `dev` and `build`.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    // starting the dev server
    "dev": "rsbuild dev",
    // build the app for production
    "build": "rsbuild build",
    // preview the production build locally
    "preview": "rsbuild preview"
  }
}
```

Refer to the [CLI](/guide/basic/cli) to learn about all available commands and options.

## Entry Module

By default, Rsbuild CLI uses `src/index.(js|ts|jsx|tsx)` as the entry module. You can modify the entry module using the [source.entry](/config/source/entry) option.
