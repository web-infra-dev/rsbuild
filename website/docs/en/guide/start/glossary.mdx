## Bundler

Refers to module bundlers such as [Rspack](https://rspack.dev/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

The main goal of bundlers is to bundle JavaScript, CSS and other files together, and the bundled files can be used in the browser, Node.js or other environments. When bundler processes the Web application, it builds a dependency graph and then combines every module into one or more bundles.

## CSR

CSR stands for "Client-Side Rendering". It means that the page is rendered in the browser using JavaScript, and logic such as data fetching, templates, and routing is completed on the client side rather than the server.

In CSR, the server sends an empty HTML shell and some JavaScript scripts to the browser, and the browser fetching data from the server's API and renders dynamic content to the page.

## Environment

import Environment from '@en/shared/environment.mdx';

<Environment />

## Micro-frontend

Micro-frontend (MFE) is an architecture style similar to microservices. It is a composition of multiple independently delivered frontend applications, forming a cohesive whole. MFE decomposes frontend applications into smaller, simpler applications that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently while still appearing as a cohesive single product to users.

It primarily addresses two problems:

- Difficulty in maintaining large and complex applications as they evolve over time.
- Inefficiency caused by cross-team or cross-department collaboration in project development.

## Modern.js

Modern.js is an open source web engineering system from ByteDance, which provides multiple solutions to help developers solve problems in different development scenarios.

## Module Federation

Module Federation is an architectural pattern for the decentralization of JavaScript applications (similar to microservices on the server-side). It allows you to share code and resources among multiple JavaScript applications (or micro-frontends). This can help you:

- Reduce code duplication
- Improve code maintainability
- Lower the overall size of your applications
- Enhance the performance of your applications

Please refer to [Module Federation guide](/guide/advanced/module-federation) for details.

## Rspack

[Rspack](https://rspack.dev/) is a high performance JavaScript bundler based on Rust, with interoperability with the webpack ecosystem, allowing it to be integrated into webpack projects at a low cost while providing better build performance.

Compared to webpack, Rspack has significantly improved build performance, thanks not only to the language advantages brought by Rust, but also to its parallel architecture and incremental compilation features. Benchmarking has shown that Rspack can provide 5-10 times better compilation performance.

## Rspress

Rspress is a fast static site generator based on Rsbuild.

## SSR

import SSR from '@en/shared/ssr.mdx';

<SSR />

## SWC

SWC (Speedy Web Compiler) is a transformer and minimizer for JavaScript and TypeScript based on Rust. SWC can provide the same abilities with Babel, and it's more than 10x faster than Babel.

Rsbuild supports SWC by default, power your web application with polyfill and minification.
