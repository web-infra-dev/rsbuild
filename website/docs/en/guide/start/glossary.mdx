## Bundler

Refers to module bundlers such as [Rspack](https://rspack.dev/) and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

The main goal of bundlers is to bundle JavaScript, CSS and other files together, and the bundled files can be used in the browser, Node.js or other environments. When bundler processes the Web application, it builds a dependency graph and then combines every module into one or more bundles.

## CSR

CSR stands for "Client-Side Rendering". It means that the page is rendered in the browser using JavaScript, and logic such as data fetching, templates, and routing is completed on the client side rather than the server.

In CSR, the server sends an empty HTML shell and some JavaScript scripts to the browser, and the browser fetching data from the server's API and renders dynamic content to the page.

## Environment

The runtime environment for build output, see [Multi-Environment Builds](/guide/advanced/environments).

## Micro-frontend

Micro-frontend (MFE) is an architecture style similar to microservices. It is a composition of multiple independently delivered frontend applications, forming a cohesive whole. MFE decomposes frontend applications into smaller, simpler applications that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently while still appearing as a cohesive single product to users.

It primarily addresses two problems:

- Difficulty in maintaining large and complex applications as they evolve over time.
- Inefficiency caused by cross-team or cross-department collaboration in project development.

## Modern.js

[Modern.js](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/modern.js) is an open source web engineering system from ByteDance, which provides multiple solutions to help developers solve problems in different development scenarios.

## Module Federation

Module Federation is an architectural pattern for JavaScript application decomposition (similar to microservices on the server-side), allowing you to share code and resources between multiple JavaScript applications (or micro-frontends).

See [Module Federation](/guide/advanced/module-federation) for more details.

## Rspack

[Rspack](https://rspack.dev/) is a high performance JavaScript bundler written in Rust. It offers strong compatibility with the webpack ecosystem, allowing for seamless replacement of webpack, and provides lightning fast build speeds.

## Rspress

[Rspress](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspress) is a fast static site generator based on Rsbuild.

## SSR

SSR stands for "Server-Side Rendering". It means that the HTML of the web page is generated by the server and sent to the client, rather than sending only an empty HTML shell and relying on JavaScript to generate the page content.

See [Server-Side Rendering (SSR)](/guide/advanced/ssr) for more details.

## SWC

SWC (Speedy Web Compiler) is a transformer and minimizer for JavaScript and TypeScript based on Rust.

See [Configure SWC](/guide/basic/configure-swc) for more details.
