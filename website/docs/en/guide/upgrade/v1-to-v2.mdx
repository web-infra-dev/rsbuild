# Upgrading from v1 to v2

This document lists all breaking changes from Rsbuild 1.x to 2.0. Use it as a migration reference.

> This guide is a work in progress. Content will be added incrementally as Rsbuild 2.0 beta evolves.

## Dropping webpack support

Rsbuild 2.0 no longer supports using webpack as the bundler. In Rsbuild 1.x, this capability was mainly used to validate compatibility between Rspack and webpack. As Rspack has gradually matured and stabilized, this purpose is no longer necessary, so the related support has been removed.

The specific changes are as follows:

- The `@rsbuild/webpack` package is no longer provided.
- The `@rsbuild/plugin-webpack-swc` package is no longer provided.
