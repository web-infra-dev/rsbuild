# Build Profiling

Performing a performance analysis can help you identify performance bottlenecks in your project, allowing for targeted optimization.

## Using Rsdoctor

Rsdoctor is a build analyser that can visually display the compilation time of each loaders and plugins.

Please refer to [Use Rsdoctor](/guide/debug/rsdoctor) for more information.

## Node.js Profiling

In general, the performance overhead on the JS side will be greater than that on the Rust side, and you can use Node.js profiling to analyze the overhead on the JS side.

Run the following command in the project root:

```bash
# dev
node --cpu-prof ./node_modules/@rsbuild/core/bin/rsbuild.js dev

# build
node --cpu-prof ./node_modules/@rsbuild/core/bin/rsbuild.js build
```

The above commands will generate a cpuprofile file. We can use [speedscope](https://github.com/jlfwong/speedscope) to visualize this file:

```bash
# Install speedscope
npm install -g speedscope

# View cpuprofile content
# Replace the name with the local file name
speedscope CPU.date.000000.00000.0.001.cpuprofile
```

## Rspack Profiling

Rsbuild supports the use of the `RSPACK_PROFILE` environment variable for Rspack build performance profile.

```bash
# dev
RSPACK_PROFILE=ALL rsbuild dev

# build
RSPACK_PROFILE=ALL rsbuild build
```

This command will generate a `rspack-profile-${timestamp}` folder in the dist folder, and it will contain `logging.json`, `trace.json` and `jscpuprofile.json` files:

- `trace.json`: The time spent on each phase of the Rust side is recorded at a granular level using tracing and can be viewed using [ui.perfetto.dev](https://ui.perfetto.dev/).
- `jscpuprofile.json`: The time spent at each stage on the JavaScript side is recorded at a granular level using [Node.js inspector](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/inspector.html) and can be viewed using [speedscope.app](https://www.speedscope.app/).
- `logging.json`: Includes some logging information that keeps a coarse-grained record of how long each phase of the build took. (Not supported in development environment yet)

For more information about Rspack build performance analysis usage, please refer to [Rspack - Profiling](https://web-infra-dev.github.io/rspack-dev-guide/profiling/intro.html#profiling).
