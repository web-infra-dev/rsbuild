# Preact

In this document, you will learn how to build a Preact application using Rsbuild.

## Create Preact project

You can use `create-rsbuild` to create a project with Rsbuild + Preact. Just execute the following command:

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

<PackageManagerTabs
  command={{
    npm: 'npm create rsbuild@latest',
    yarn: 'yarn create rsbuild',
    pnpm: 'pnpm create rsbuild@latest',
    bun: 'bun create rsbuild@latest',
  }}
/>

Then select `Preact` when prompted to "Select framework".

## Use Preact in an existing project

To compile Preact, you need to register the Rsbuild [Preact Plugin](/plugins/list/plugin-preact). The plugin will automatically add the necessary configuration for Preact builds.

For example, register in `rsbuild.config.ts`:

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@rsbuild/core';
import { pluginPreact } from '@rsbuild/plugin-preact';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [pluginPreact()],
});
```

## Preact Fast Refresh

Preact plugin uses [@preact/prefresh](https://github.com/preactjs/prefresh) and [@rspack/plugin-preact-refresh](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/rspack-plugin-preact-refresh) to hot reload Preact components.

### Recognition

Prefresh need to be able to recognize your components, this means that components should
start with a capital letter and hook should start with `use` followed by a capital letter.
This allows the plugin to effectively recognize these.

Do note that a component as seen below is not named:

```jsx
export default () => {
  return <p>Want to refresh</p>;
};
```

Instead do:

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  return <p>Want to refresh</p>;
};

export default MyComponent;
```

When you are working with HOC's be sure to lift up the `displayName` so the plugin can
recognize it as a component.
