# Bundle size optimization

Bundle size optimization is an important part of production builds because it directly affects the user experience. This document introduces common bundle size optimization methods in Rsbuild.

## Reduce duplicate dependencies

It is common for web projects to bundle multiple versions of third-party dependencies. Duplicate dependencies can lead to increased bundle size and slower build speed.

### Detect duplicate dependencies

You can use [Rsdoctor](https://rsdoctor.rs) to detect duplicate dependencies in your project. Rsdoctor analyzes the build, finds duplicate bundled dependencies, and displays them visually:

For more details, see [Rsdoctor - Duplicate Dependency Problem](https://rsdoctor.rs/blog/topic/duplicate-pkg-problem).

### Eliminate duplicate dependencies

You can eliminate duplicate dependencies using your package manager.

- Rsbuild provides the [resolve.dedupe](/config/resolve/dedupe) config, which allows you to force the specified packages to be resolved from the project root directory, thereby removing duplicate packages.

- If you are using `pnpm >= 7.26.0`, you can use the [pnpm dedupe](https://pnpm.io/cli/dedupe) command to upgrade and eliminate duplicate dependencies.

```bash
pnpm dedupe
```

- If you are using `pnpm < 7.26.0`, you can use [pnpm-deduplicate](https://github.com/ocavue/pnpm-deduplicate) to analyze all duplicate dependencies, then update dependencies or declare [pnpm overrides](https://pnpm.io/package_json#pnpmoverrides) to merge duplicated dependencies.

```bash
npx pnpm-deduplicate --list
```

- If you are using `yarn`, you can use [yarn-deduplicate](https://github.com/scinos/yarn-deduplicate) to automatically merge duplicated dependencies:

```bash
npx yarn-deduplicate && yarn
```

## Use lightweight libraries

We recommend using lightweight libraries in your project, such as replacing [moment](https://momentjs.com/) with [day.js](https://day.js.org/).

To find out the large libraries in the project, add the `BUNDLE_ANALYZE=true` environment variable when building:

```bash
BUNDLE_ANALYZE=true pnpm build
```

See the [performance.bundleAnalyze](/config/performance/bundle-analyze) configuration for details.

## Adjust browserslist

Rsbuild will compile the code based on the project's browserslist config and inject some polyfills. If your project doesn't need to support legacy browsers, you can adjust the browserslist to drop support for older browsers, reducing the compilation overhead for syntax transformation and polyfills.

Rsbuild's default Browserslist config is:

```js
['chrome >= 87', 'edge >= 88', 'firefox >= 78', 'safari >= 14'];
```

For example, if you only need to be compatible with browsers above Chrome 100, you can change it to:

```js
['Chrome >= 100'];
```

## Usage polyfill

If the current project's [output.polyfill](/config/output/polyfill) is set to `'entry'`, and you are certain that third-party dependencies do not require additional polyfills, you can change it to `usage`.

In `usage` mode, Rsbuild analyzes the syntax used in the source code and injects the required polyfill code on demand to reduce the size of polyfill.

```js
export default {
  output: {
    polyfill: 'usage',
  },
};
```

## Image compression

In typical front-end projects, images often account for a large proportion of the total bundle size. Reducing image size can significantly improve bundle size. You can enable image compression by registering a plugin in Rsbuild:

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
import { pluginImageCompress } from '@rsbuild/plugin-image-compress';

export default {
  plugins: [pluginImageCompress()],
};
```

See details in [@rsbuild/plugin-image-compress](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/rsbuild-plugin-image-compress).

## Split chunk

A good chunk splitting strategy is important for improving application loading performance. It makes full use of the browser's caching mechanism to reduce the number of requests and improve loading speed.

Several [chunk splitting strategies](/guide/optimization/code-splitting) are built into Rsbuild. These should meet the needs of most applications. You can also customize the chunk splitting config to suit your own usage scenario.

For example, split the `axios` library under node_modules into `axios.js`:

```js
export default {
  performance: {
    chunkSplit: {
      strategy: 'split-by-experience',
      forceSplitting: {
        axios: /node_modules[\\/]axios/,
      },
    },
  },
};
```
