# Improve Build Performance

Rsbuild optimizes build performance by default, but as the project becomes larger, you may encounter some build performance problems.

This document provides some optional speed-up methods, developers can choose some of them to improve the build performance.

## Performance Profiling

Performing a performance analysis can help you identify performance bottlenecks in your project, allowing for targeted optimization.

Please refer to the [Performance Building Analysis](/guide/debug/build-profiling) section for more information.

## General Optimization

The following are some general optimization methods, which can speed up the development build and production build.

### Reducing Modules

Optimizing the number of modules referenced by the application can reduce the bundle size and improve build performance. Please read the [Bundle Size Optimization](/guide/optimization/optimize-bundle) section to learn some optimization methods.

## Development optimization

The following are methods for improving performance in development mode.

## Enable Lazy Compilation

Enabling lazy compilation can significantly reduce the number of modules compiled at dev startup and improve startup time.

```js
export default {
  dev: {
    lazyCompilation: true,
  },
};
```

> Please refer to [dev.lazyCompilation](/config/dev/lazy-compilation) for more information.

### Source Map Format

In order to provide a good debugging experience, Rsbuild uses the `cheap-module-source-map` format source map by default in development mode, which is a high-quality source map format and will bring certain performance overhead.

You can improve build speed by adjusting the source map format in development mode through [output.sourceMap](/config/output/source-map).

For example to disable source map:

```js
export default {
  output: {
    sourceMap: {
      js: false,
    },
  },
};
```

Or set the source map format of the development mode to the cheapest `eval` format:

```js
export default {
  output: {
    sourceMap: {
      js: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? 'eval' : false,
    },
  },
};
```

> For detailed differences between different source map formats, see [Rspack - devtool](https://rspack.dev/config/devtool).

### Browserslist for development

This strategy is similar to ["Adjust Browserslist"](/guide/optimization/optimize-bundle#adjust-browserslist), the difference is that we can set different browserslist for development and production mode, thereby reducing the compilation overhead in development mode.

For example, you can add the following config to `.browserslistrc`, which means that only the latest browsers are compatible in development mode, and the actual browsers are compatible in the production mode:

```yaml title=".browserslistrc"
[production]
chrome >= 87
edge >= 88
firefox >= 78
safari >= 14

[development]
last 1 chrome version
last 1 firefox version
last 1 safari version
```

Note that this can lead to some differences in the build result between development and production modes.
