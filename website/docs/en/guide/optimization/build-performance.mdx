# Improve build performance

Rsbuild optimizes build performance by default, but you may encounter performance issues as your project grows larger.

This document provides optional optimization methods to improve build performance.

## Performance profiling

Performance profiling helps identify bottlenecks in your project, enabling targeted optimization.

See the [Build Performance Analysis](/guide/debug/build-profiling) section.

## General optimization

These general optimization methods can speed up both development and production builds.

### Upgrade Rsbuild

Upgrading to the latest version of Rsbuild provides the latest performance optimizations. See [Upgrade Rsbuild](/guide/basic/upgrade-rsbuild) for more details.

### Enable persistent cache

Rsbuild provides [performance.buildCache](/config/performance/build-cache) configuration to significantly improve rebuild speed.

### Reduce module count

Optimizing the number of modules referenced by the application reduces bundle size and improves build performance. Read the [Bundle Size Optimization](/guide/optimization/optimize-bundle) section to learn optimization methods.

### Optimize Tailwind CSS

When using Tailwind CSS v3, incorrectly configuring the `content` field in `tailwind.config.js` can lead to poor build and HMR performance.

See [Tailwind CSS v3 - Optimize build performance](/guide/styling/tailwindcss-v3#optimize-build-performance) for more details.

### Parallel Less compilation

If your project uses the [@rsbuild/plugin-less](/plugins/list/plugin-less) plugin with a large number of Less files, you can try enabling parallel compilation to improve build performance.

See [Less Plugin - parallel](/plugins/list/plugin-less#parallel) for more details.

### Tool selection

While Rsbuild delivers excellent build performance out of the box, certain JavaScript-based tools can negatively impact performance, particularly in large projects.

- [@rsbuild/plugin-babel](/plugins/list/plugin-babel): This plugin is based on Babel. We recommend using the more performant [SWC](/guide/configuration/swc) for code transformation instead.
- [@rsbuild/plugin-less](/plugins/list/plugin-less): The Less compiler has relatively poor performance. Consider using [@rsbuild/plugin-sass](/plugins/list/plugin-sass) or other performant CSS solutions as alternatives.
- [terser-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/terser-webpack-plugin): You can replace Terser with faster minimizers, such as Rsbuild's built-in [SWC](/guide/configuration/swc) minifier.

## Development optimization

These methods improve performance in development mode.

### Enable lazy compilation

Enabling lazy compilation can significantly reduce the number of modules compiled at dev startup and improve startup time.

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
export default {
  dev: {
    lazyCompilation: true,
  },
};
```

> See [dev.lazyCompilation](/config/dev/lazy-compilation) for more information.

### Enable native watcher

Enabling Rspack's [native watcher](https://rspack.rs/config/experiments#experimentsnativewatcher) can improve HMR performance in development mode.

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
export default {
  tools: {
    rspack: {
      experiments: {
        nativeWatcher: true,
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### Source map format

To provide a good debugging experience, Rsbuild uses the `cheap-module-source-map` format in development mode by default. This is a high-quality source map format with some performance overhead.

You can improve build speed by adjusting the source map format through [output.sourceMap](/config/output/source-map).

For example, to disable source maps:

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
export default {
  output: {
    sourceMap: {
      js: false,
    },
  },
};
```

Or set the source map format to the fastest `eval` format in development mode:

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
export default {
  output: {
    sourceMap: {
      js: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? 'eval' : false,
    },
  },
};
```

> For detailed differences between different source map formats, see [Rspack - devtool](https://rspack.rs/config/devtool).

### Browserslist for development

This strategy is similar to ["Adjust Browserslist"](/guide/optimization/optimize-bundle#adjust-browserslist). The difference is that we can set different browserslist configurations for development and production, thereby reducing compilation overhead in development.

For example, you can add the following config to `.browserslistrc` to target only the latest browsers in development while supporting a broader range in production:

```yaml title=".browserslistrc"
[production]
chrome >= 87
edge >= 88
firefox >= 78
safari >= 14

[development]
last 1 chrome version
last 1 firefox version
last 1 safari version
```

Note that this can lead to differences in build output between development and production modes.
