# Code splitting

A good chunk splitting strategy is important for improving application load performance. It leverages browser caching to reduce requests and improve loading speed.

Several [chunk splitting strategies](/guide/optimization/code-splitting) are built into Rsbuild to meet the needs of most applications. You can also customize chunk splitting configuration for specific use cases.

> See [Rspack - Code Splitting](https://rspack.rs/guide/optimization/code-splitting) for more details.

## Strategies

> The chunk splitting configuration of Rsbuild is in [performance.chunkSplit](/config/performance/chunk-split).

Rsbuild supports the following chunk splitting strategies:

- `split-by-experience`: an empirical splitting strategy that automatically splits some commonly used npm packages into chunks of moderate size.
- `split-by-module`: split by npm package granularity, where each npm package corresponds to a chunk.
- `split-by-size`: automatically split based on module size.
- `all-in-one`: bundle all code into one chunk.
- `single-vendor`: bundle all npm packages into a single chunk.
- `custom`: custom chunk splitting strategy.

::: tip
When using strategies other than `all-in-one`, Rspack's default splitting rules will also take effect. For more details, see [Rspack - SplitChunksPlugin](https://rspack.rs/plugins/webpack/split-chunks-plugin#default-behavior).
:::

## split-by-experience

### Behavior

Rsbuild uses the `split-by-experience` strategy by default, an optimization strategy based on practical experience. When your application uses the following npm packages, they're automatically split into separate chunks:

- `lib-polyfill.js`: Contains `core-js`, `@swc/helpers`, `tslib`
- `lib-axios.js`: Contains `axios`
- `lib-react.js`: Provided by [@rsbuild/plugin-react](/plugins/list/plugin-react#splitchunks)
- `lib-vue.js`: Provided by [@rsbuild/plugin-vue](/plugins/list/plugin-vue#splitchunks)

This approach groups commonly used packages and splits them into individual chunks, improving browser caching efficiency.

### Config

```ts
export default {
  performance: {
    chunkSplit: {
      strategy: 'split-by-experience',
    },
  },
};
```

### Notes

If the npm packages mentioned above aren't installed or used, the corresponding chunks won't be generated.

## split-by-module

### Behavior

Split each npm package into a separate chunk.

::: warning
This strategy splits node_modules with the finest granularity. Under HTTP/2, multiplexing can speed up resource loading. However, in non-HTTP/2 environments, use this strategy cautiously due to HTTP head-of-line blocking.
:::

### Config

```ts
export default {
  performance: {
    chunkSplit: {
      strategy: 'split-by-module',
    },
  },
};
```

### Notes

- This configuration splits node_modules into many smaller chunks, resulting in many file requests.
- With HTTP/2, resource loading accelerates and cache hit rates improve due to multiplexing.
- Without HTTP/2, page loading performance may degrade due to HTTP head-of-line blocking. Use with caution.

## all-in-one

### Behavior

This strategy puts all source code and third-party dependencies in a single chunk.

### Config

```ts
export default {
  performance: {
    chunkSplit: {
      strategy: 'all-in-one',
    },
  },
};
```

### Notes

- This configuration bundles all generated JS code into a single file (except dynamically imported chunks).
- The single JS file may be very large, potentially reducing page loading performance.

To also bundle dynamically imported chunks into a single file, set the [output.asyncChunks](https://rspack.rs/config/output#outputasyncchunks) option in Rspack to `false`:

```js
export default defineConfig({
  performance: {
    chunkSplit: {
      strategy: 'all-in-one',
    },
  },
  tools: {
    rspack: {
      output: {
        asyncChunks: false,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

## single-vendor

### Behavior

This strategy puts third-party dependencies in one chunk and source code in another.

### Config

```ts
export default {
  performance: {
    chunkSplit: {
      strategy: 'single-vendor',
    },
  },
};
```

### Notes

The single vendor file may be very large, potentially reducing page loading performance.

## split-by-size

### Behavior

With this strategy, after setting `minSize` and `maxSize` to fixed values, Rsbuild will automatically split chunks without extra configuration.

### Config

```ts
export default {
  performance: {
    chunkSplit: {
      strategy: 'split-by-size',
      minSize: 30000,
      maxSize: 50000,
    },
  },
};
```

## Custom splitting strategy

In addition to built-in strategies, you can also customize the splitting strategy for more specific needs. Custom strategies have two parts:

- Custom group
- Custom Rspack `splitChunks` config

Note that these custom capabilities can be used together with built-in strategies; you can use built-in strategies to split common packages and custom functions to split other packages.

### Custom group

Rsbuild supports custom groups, which are more flexible than built-in strategies and simpler than writing Rspack's `splitChunks` config.

For example, split the `axios` library under node_modules into `axios.js`:

```js
export default {
  performance: {
    chunkSplit: {
      forceSplitting: {
        axios: /node_modules[\\/]axios/,
      },
    },
  },
};
```

Through `forceSplitting` config, you can easily split packages into chunks.

#### Notes

Chunks split using `forceSplitting` are inserted into the HTML file as initial resources using `<script>` tags. Split them appropriately based on your scenario to avoid excessive initial bundle size.

### Custom config

In addition to custom grouping, you can also customize Rspack's `splitChunks` config through `override`. For example:

- Set `minSize` to 30,000 so modules smaller than 30,000 bytes will not be split.

```ts
export default {
  performance: {
    chunkSplit: {
      override: {
        chunks: 'all',
        minSize: 30000,
      },
    },
  },
};
```

- Bundle all CSS files into a single `styles.css`.

```ts
export default {
  performance: {
    chunkSplit: {
      override: {
        cacheGroups: {
          styles: {
            name: 'styles',
            minSize: 0,
            chunks: 'all',
            test: /\.(?:css|less|sass|scss|styl)$/,
            priority: 99,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

The `override` config will be merged with Rspack's `splitChunks` config. For specific config details, see [Rspack - splitChunks](https://rspack.rs/config/optimization#optimizationsplitchunks).

## Using dynamic import for code splitting

In addition to the `chunkSplit` configuration, using [dynamic import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) is also an important optimization technique that can effectively reduce initial bundle size.

:::tip About dynamic import
Dynamic import is a feature introduced in ECMAScript 2020 that allows you to dynamically load JavaScript modules. Rspack supports dynamic import by default, so you can use it directly in your code.
:::

When the bundler encounters `import()` syntax, it automatically splits the relevant code into a new chunk and loads it on-demand at runtime.

For example, if your project has a large module called `bigModule.ts` (which can also be a third-party dependency), you can use dynamic import to load it on-demand:

```js
// Somewhere in your code where you need to use bigModule
import('./bigModule.ts').then((bigModule) => {
  // Use bigModule here
});
```

When you run the build command, `bigModule.ts` will be automatically split into a new chunk and loaded on-demand at runtime.
