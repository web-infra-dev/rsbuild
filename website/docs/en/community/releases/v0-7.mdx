Rsbuild v0.7 has been released along with Rspack v0.7!

Notable changes:

## output.dataUriLimit defaults

The default value for [output.dataUriLimit](/config/output/data-uri-limit) has been changed from `10000 (10kB)` to `4096 (4KiB)`.

This is because more applications are currently using HTTP 2.0, so splitting assets into separate files would perform better. Meanwhile, inlining assets over 4KiB can make the JS bundle to be too large and not cache friendly.

If you prefer the previous defaults, add the following config:

```js title="rsbuild.config.ts"
export default {
  output: {
    dataUriLimit: 10000,
  },
};
```
