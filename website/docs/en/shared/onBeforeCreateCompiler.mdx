`onBeforeCreateCompiler` is a callback function that is triggered after the Compiler instance has been created, but before the build process begins. This hook is called when you run `rsbuild.startDevServer`, `rsbuild.build`, or `rsbuild.createCompiler`.

You can access the Rspack configuration array through the `bundlerConfigs` parameter. The array may contain one or more [Rspack configurations](https://rspack.dev/config/). It depends on whether multiple [environments](/config/environments) are configured.

- **Type:**

```ts
function OnBeforeCreateCompiler(
  callback: (params: {
    bundlerConfigs: WebpackConfig[] | RspackConfig[];
  }) => Promise<void> | void,
): void;
```
