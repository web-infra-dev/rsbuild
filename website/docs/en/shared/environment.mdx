The `environment` refers to the runtime environment for build output. Common environments include browsers, Node.js, and Workers. Rsbuild allows you to define any environment names and set build options for each environment individually.

A typical scenario is server-side rendering (SSR). You can define two environments, `web` and `node`, where the build targets ([output.target](/config/output/target)) are `web` and `node`. These are used for client-side rendering (CSR) and server-side rendering (SSR) scenarios.

You can also define different environments for the same build target, for example:

- Define `rsc` and `ssr` environments, both targeting `node`, used separately for React Server Components and SSR.
- Define `desktop` and `mobile` environments, both targeting `web`, used separately for desktop and mobile browsers.

Without the `environments` configuration, you would need to define multiple configurations for these scenarios and run multiple independent Rsbuild builds. Now, with the `environments` configuration, you can complete the build for multiple outputs in a single Rsbuild run (Rsbuild achieves this using Rspack's `MultiCompiler`).

In Rsbuild, each `environment` is associated with an Rsbuild configuration, an Rspack configuration, and a set of build outputs. Rsbuild plugin developers can customize the build process for a specified environment based on the `environment` name, such as modifying Rsbuild or Rspack configurations, registering or removing plugins, adjusting Rspack rules, and viewing assets information.
