Bundler chain is a subset of webpack chain, which contains part of the webpack chain API that you can use to modify both Rspack and webpack configuration.

Configurations modified via bundler chain will work on both Rspack and webpack builds. Note that the bundler chain only supports modifying the configuration of the non-differentiated parts of Rspack and webpack. For example, modifying the devtool configuration option (Rspack and webpack have the same devtool property value type), or adding an [Rspack-compatible](https://rspack.dev/guide/compatibility/plugin) webpack plugin.
