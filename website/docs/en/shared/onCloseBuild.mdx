Called when closing the build instance. Can be used to perform cleanup operations when the building is closed.

Rsbuild CLI will automatically call this hook after running [rsbuild build](/guide/basic/cli#rsbuild-build), while users of the JavaScript API need to manually call the [rsbuild.close()](/api/javascript-api/instance#rsbuildbuild) method to trigger this hook.

- **Type:**

```ts
function onCloseBuild(callback: () => Promise<void> | void): void;
```
