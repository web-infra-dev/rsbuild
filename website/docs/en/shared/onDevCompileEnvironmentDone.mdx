Called after each build of a single environment during development, you can use `isFirstCompile` to determine whether it is the first build.

- **Type:**

```ts
function OnDevCompileEnvironmentDone(
  callback: (params: {
    isFirstCompile: boolean;
    stats: Stats;
    environment: EnvironmentContext;
  }) => Promise<void> | void,
): void;
```
