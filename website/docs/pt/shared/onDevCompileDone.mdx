Called after each development mode build, you can use `isFirstCompile` to determine whether it is the first build.

- **Type:**

```ts
function OnDevCompileDone(
  callback: (params: {
    isFirstCompile: boolean;
    stats: Stats | MultiStats;
    environments: Record<string, EnvironmentContext>;
  }) => Promise<void> | void,
): void;
```
