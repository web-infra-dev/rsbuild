# html.crossorigin

- **Type:** `boolean | 'anonymous' | 'use-credentials'`
- **Default:** `false`

Set the [crossorigin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin) attribute of the `<script>` and `<style>` tags.

- If `true` is passed, it will automatically be set to `crossorigin="anonymous"`.
- If `false` is passed, it will not set the `crossorigin` attr.

## Example

```js
export default {
  html: {
    crossorigin: 'anonymous',
  },
  output: {
    assetPrefix: 'https://example.com',
  },
};
```

After compilation, the `<script>` tag in HTML becomes:

```html
<script
  defer
  src="https://example.com/static/js/main.js"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

The `<style>` tag becomes:

```html
<link
  href="https://example.com/static/css/main.css"
  rel="stylesheet"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
/>
```

:::tip
If the domain of static assets is the same as the current page, Rsbuild will not add the crossorigin="anonymous" attribute, as this attribute is not required for non-cross-domain scenario.

## Optional values

`crossorigin` can the set to the following values:

- `anonymous`: Request uses CORS headers and credentials flag is set to 'same-origin'. There is no exchange of user credentials via cookies, client-side SSL certificates or HTTP authentication, unless destination is the same origin.
- `use-credentials`: Request uses CORS headers, credentials flag is set to 'include' and user credentials are always included.
