# server.host

- **Type:** `string`
- **Default:** `0.0.0.0`

Specify the host that the Rsbuild server listens to.

By default, the Rsbuild server will listen to `0.0.0.0`, which means listening to all IPv4 network interfaces, including `localhost` and public network addresses.

You can use `server.host` or the `--host` CLI param to set the host (The priority of `--host` option is higher than `server.host`).

If you want the Rsbuild server to listen only on `localhost`, you can set it to:

```ts
export default {
  server: {
    host: 'localhost',
  },
};
```

## IPv6 Support

If you want the Rsbuild server to listen all IPv6 network interfaces, you can set it to:

```ts
export default {
  server: {
    host: '::',
  },
};
```

If you want the Rsbuild server to listen a specified IPv6 host, you can set it to:

```ts
export default {
  server: {
    host: '::1',
  },
};
```

At this point, you can access the page via `http://[::1]:3000/`.
