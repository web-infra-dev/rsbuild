# performance.profile

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `false`

Whether capture timing information for each module, same as the [profile](https://rspack.rs/config/other-options#profile) config of Rspack.

After enabled:

- Rsbuild will auto-generate `dist/stats.json` file through [bundle analyzer](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer).
- Rspack will include the build time information when generating stats.json or other statistics files.

## Example

```js
export default {
  performance: {
    profile: true,
  },
};
```

When enabled, Rspack generates a JSON file with some statistics about the module that includes information about timing information for each module.

## Guide

Please refer to the [Build profiling](/guide/debug/build-profiling) page for more methods to analyze build performance.
