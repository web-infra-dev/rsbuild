# output.externals

- **Type:**

```ts
type Externals =
  | string
  | object
  | function
  | RegExp
  | Array<string | object | function | RegExp>;
```

- **Default:** `undefined`

At build time, prevent some `import` dependencies from being packed into bundles in your code, and instead fetch them externally at runtime.

> For more information, please see: [Rspack Externals](https://rspack.rs/config/externals).

## Example

Exclude the `react-dom` dependency from the build product. To get this module at runtime, the value of `react-dom` will globally retrieve the `ReactDOM` variable.

```js
export default {
  output: {
    externals: {
      'react-dom': 'ReactDOM',
    },
  },
};
```

:::tip
If [output.target](/config/output/target) is `web-worker`, externals will not take effect. This is because the Web Worker environment can not access global variables.
