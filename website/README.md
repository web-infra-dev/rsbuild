# Rsbuild website

This website is built with [Rspress](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspress), the document content can be written using markdown or mdx syntax. You can refer to the [Rspress Website](https://rspress.rs/) for detailed usage.

## Contributing

Currently Rsbuild provides documentation in English and Chinese. If you can use Chinese, please update both documents at the same time. Otherwise, just update the English documentation.

## Writing style guide

The same as Rspack: [Writing style guide](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspack/tree/main/website#writing-style-guide).

### Image assets

For images you use in the document, it's better to upload them to the [rspack-contrib/rstack-design-resources](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/rstack-design-resources) repository, so the size of the current repository doesn't get too big.

After you upload the images there, they will be automatically deployed under the https://assets.rspack.rs/.
