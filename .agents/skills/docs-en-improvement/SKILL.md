# Docs En Improvement

## Steps

1. Focus on files in `website/docs/en`.

2. Rewrite only sentences that clearly improve clarity, correctness, or naturalness in English.

3. Preserve original meaning exactly; do not introduce new claims or remove technical details.

4. If a file in `website/docs/en` is updated, check the mirrored file in `website/docs/zh` and apply equivalent updates when needed.

## Constraints

- Limit each PR to 10 documentation files or fewer.
- Start PR titles with `docs:`.
- Keep reasonable technical abbreviations (for example, `dev server`).
- Keep wording simple and readable for non-native English readers.
- Use sentence case for Markdown headings.
