# @rsbuild/e2e

This folder contains the E2E test cases of Rsbuild. The E2E suite is powered by [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright).

## Directory structure

- `cases`: Test cases covering different Rsbuild features.
- `assets`: Common static assets, can be accessed using the `@e2e/assets` package.
- `scripts`: Shared helpers, can be accessed using the `@e2e/helper` package.

## Commands

```bash
# Run all test cases
pnpm e2e

# Run specific test case, such as "css"
pnpm e2e css
```

## Debugging

If a test directory includes an `rsbuild.config.*` file, you can simply run `npx rsbuild dev` or `npx rsbuild build` to start it. This approach provides a simpler and more convenient way to debug.

```bash
cd cases/assets/emit-assets
npx rsbuild dev
npx rsbuild build
```

## Add test cases

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('test 1 + 1', () => {
  expect(1 + 1).toBe(2);
});
```
